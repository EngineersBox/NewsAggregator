Posted

As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to grow in Australia, local authorities have sought to reassure Canberrans that no community transmission of the virus has been detected in the ACT.

Effectively, what that means is all of the ACT's cases fall into high-risk groups: those who have travelled interstate or overseas, or those who have been in close proximity to another confirmed case of COVID-19.

It can be a reassuring thought that you are unlikely to contract the illness by going about your daily business in Canberra, but the situation raises an inevitable question: how do we know the virus isn't spreading if we only test people who are already in the risk categories?

Canaries in the coalmine

The ACT has a testing rate of just under five tests per 1,000 people, and most of those tested are displaying symptoms and have either been overseas, travelled to a high-risk area interstate, or had close contact with someone who has COVID-19.

Testing was expanded over the weekend to include symptomatic people in high-density living situations like boarding schools and aged-care facilities. Hospital admissions showing COVID-19 symptoms are also tested.

But if the average person comes down with flu-like symptoms, they will likely not be tested.

Who should get tested? Seek medical attention if you develop a fever, cough, sore throat or shortness of breath: within 14 days of overseas travel

following contact with someone who has COVID-19

if you're a healthcare worker with direct patient contact — even if you have not recently travelled or had contact with someone who has COVID-19

People wishing to be tested should call their GP ahead of time, visit the drive-through testing centre at EPIC or the Weston Creek Walk-in Centre, or call Healthdirect on 1800 022 222.

It has prompted concern among many in the community and on social media that local transmission is going undetected in the general public.

But there are canaries in the coronavirus coalmine, the Government says, that would set off alarm bells on community transmission: healthcare workers.

""Our testing of healthcare workers who are symptomatic and have no known exposure … enables us to have a good indication of whether we're starting to see local transmission in the ACT,"" Health Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith said.

Ms Stephen-Smith said a positive test of such a person would likely be the first sign of community transmission in the ACT.

""Or from someone who arrives in hospital with severe pneumonia or severe respiratory illness, who has no other explanation for it — those people are being tested as well,"" she said.

All healthcare providers are recommended to be tested if they develop a fever or respiratory ailments — even if they have not been overseas or in contact with COVID-19 patients.

The Government says if they start seeing positive results among that group, it will be evidence of community transmission.

So far, all of those tests have been negative, leading to Government assurances there is no evidence of coronavirus spreading widely in the Canberra community.

So who has been infected?

Authorities say they will become far more concerned when new patients begin appearing without any links to known cases.

As of Tuesday afternoon, 39 people in the ACT had tested positive for COVID-19, and none of them fit that criteria.

Here's how authorities believe they got the virus:

Overseas travel: 32 people

Close contact with a confirmed case in Canberra: 3 people

Close contact with a confirmed case interstate: 4 people

Tim Newsome, who lectures in virology the University of Sydney, said Governments need to target testing to certain groups, as there are not enough testing kits to test everybody who gets sick.

""At the current state, these testing kits are in finite supply,"" Dr Newsome said.

""Testing the whole population is just not feasible.""

ACT COVID-19 snapshot Confirmed cases so far: 39

Tested negative: 2,780 Latest information from ACT Health

Associate Professor Newsome said using healthcare workers as an indicator of whether there were more cases of COVID-19 in the community made sense.

""I think healthcare workers make sense from the perspective that you are protecting patients and also looking at community transmission,"" he said.

""You are learning about community transmission, and you are also, by identifying COVID-positive healthcare workers, able to remove them to quarantine and allow them to self-isolate and protect people who need treatment.

When will this change?

Changes to the testing regime have been put on the table for this week.

""We'll be removing the traveller component, but we're working on that at the moment,"" deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly said on Q+A on Monday.

""There will be announcements about that over the coming days.""

Ms Stephen-Smith said the Government was ready to change its testing requirements as the situation changed.

""We are very confident that the ACT and Australia have one of the highest testing rates in the world,"" Ms Stephen-Smith said.

""That testing criteria is under review every single day.""

Updated

Passengers on a Canberra bus that went from Dickson to Kaleen last week are being urged to self-isolate, amid concerns they may have come into contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19.

Key points: Thirty-nine people have now been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ACT

Passengers on a bus caught by a confirmed case are being told to self-quarantine

ACT public transport will only be for essential travel, though services remain for now

The person who caught the number 31 bus from Dickson to Kaleen at 3:50pm on March 17 was a previously confirmed case, but authorities on Tuesday urged anyone who was on that bus, which was scheduled for 3:33pm but ran late, to quarantine themselves.

Seven new cases were confirmed in the ACT on Tuesday — two men and five women, aged between 21 and 75.

There are now a total of 39 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canberra.

Three of those are in hospital in a stable condition.

ACT COVID-19 snapshot Confirmed cases so far: 39

Tested negative: 2,780 Latest information from ACT Health

Announcing the changes, the ACT Government said the normal public transport network would continue operating for the time being, but should only be used for essential travel.

""Don't use public transport to get on the beers at your mate's house, and definitely do not use public transport if you are feeling sick or unwell,"" Transport Minister Chris Steel said.

He said people who needed help getting to a testing facility should not take the bus or tram, but call 1800 022 222 to arrange alternative transport.

The Government has also introduced changes to buses, including banning the use of cash, only allowing entry and exit via rear bus doors, and keeping front bus seats clear, in order to minimise public contact with drivers.

Mr Steel said there had been a 21 per cent drop in public transport passenger numbers compared to the same week last year.

He said the Government would delay planned changes to the public transport network.

""Our focus must be on trying to maintain current transport services as much as possible,"" he said.

First 'pupil-free' school day, but childcare centres continue

From Tuesday Canberra schools are also being run ""pupil free"".

The mixed messaging confused parents, and raised questions over whether childcare centres would follow suit.

When asked, the ACT Government said it was up to individual childcare providers to determine whether they could safely operate.

Communities@Work chief executive Lee Maiden said the number of families withdrawing children so far has been small.

She said the organisation had reduced the notice period for parents to withdraw by a week, but children who pulled out would still lose their place at preschools.

""If we have families on the waiting list looking for a place we would certainly be offering it to the next person on the waiting list, so that we can continue to operate,"" Ms Maiden said.

She said centres were implementing extra precautions.

""We actually ask families as they come in to our services to make sure they use hand sanitisers, our equipment and toys are always washed regularly,"" she said.

""If we're told we would need to close we will close our services.""

Updated

As households prepare to bunker down across Australia, attention has turned to the best ways of protecting homes from coronavirus.

Key points: Households are a new frontier in the fight against coronavirus

Experts advise detergent and disinfectant are needed to clean surfaces

They say to target high traffic areas like doorknobs, handles and benches

Health experts have recommended a series of practical steps for maintaining good hygiene at home.

UNSW virologist Dr Sacha Stelzer-Braid is confident households can minimise their exposure if the right procedures are followed.

How do I stop COVID-19 spreading to my home?

Take off your shoes at the front door.

""We just need to be really quite vigilant and strict,"" she said.

""It's not a bad idea to take your shoes off before you enter the house, especially for children who like to jump on beds,"" she said.

""Definitely don't put your shoes anywhere you would touch with your hands like your coffee table.""

Wipe down items brought into the house.

Non-porous items like takeaway containers can be wiped down with detergent or soapy water and fresh produce should be washed.

Wash your hands, thoroughly.

Once inside, a thorough hand wash with warm soapy water for at least 20 seconds is essential.

""While the risk of transmission from anything you buy at the shops is low it's still a good idea. We can't hand-wash enough right now,"" Dr Stelzer-Braid said.

What cleaning products work best?

Hand sanitisers and disinfectants are not enough.

Scientists have shown that COVID-19 can survive outside the body on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for up to 72 hours.

Professor Brett Mitchell told ABC Radio Sydney that highly sought after products like hand sanitiser and disinfectant sprays were not enough to kill the virus on their own.

""Disinfectants don't work by just splashing them about,"" Professor Mitchell said.

""They can't break through dirt and organic material that's left on surfaces, so you need to clean that first and then use the disinfectant.""

Detergents are the key to breaking down the layers of dirt and dust to allow disinfectants to work.

Target 'high-touch' surfaces

Wipe down doorknobs, switches, and mobile phones twice a day with detergent.

As the virus is commonly transferred by hand-to-face touching, experts recommend wiping down all surfaces that are regularly handled.

Cleaning house If you just want to clean, then hot, soapy water is generally enough

If you want to disinfect, clean first, then disinfect with the least toxic, most biodegradable product that does the job

Make sure that whichever product you use, you don't damage the surface you're working on

Different advice might apply if there's someone at home with an open wound or a poor immune system Source: Source: Does vinegar really kill household germs?

Dr Stelzer-Braid said those in a healthy household should be wiping down high-touch surfaces at least twice a day.

Diluted bleach and products with an alcohol content above 70 per cent are also effective products.

What if someone falls ill?

Quarantine sick house members for 14 days, increase cleaning.

If a member of the house is feeling unwell, Professor Mitchell said cleaning around areas they frequented needed to be more thorough.

""Think about cleaning the area within their room a little more often, using disinfectant after washing hands, and giving the taps a clean,"" he said.

Should a member of the household show symptoms of COVID-19, Dr Stelzer-Braid said they should be quarantined to one room, preferably with their own bathroom.

Contact with others should be at a minimum for a fortnight and cleaning should increase to several times a day.

If possible, clothes and bed sheets — handled with gloves and surgical masks — should be washed more frequently to minimise the risk of transmission.

""It's also always a good idea to try to flush clean air through the house so open the windows and doors,"" Dr Stelzer-Braid said.

Keep clothing, cutlery separate

The clothing and cutlery used by an infected person can also spread the virus so they should be kept separate.

""A dishwasher is great, it will kill the virus. But if you don't have one use hot water — as hot as you can handle it,"" she said.

Technique matters

Wiping in an 'S' shaped pattern prevents re-contamination and will ensure the surface area is well-covered.

Cleaning techniques can also make a difference to the risk of infection.

Disposable gloves should also be worn.

Dr Stelzer-Braid said the key was not waiting until it was too late to implement good habits.

""Getting on top of it early and having a good routine is really important,"" she said.

""If [infection] does happen, and it probably will happen to someone in the household, then it's an easier transition.""

While these measures might not guarantee freedom from infection, Dr Stelzer-Braid said they help ensure the chances of the virus entering a home are minimised.

Updated

These are the most unusual of times, and every day, the ACT Government is being forced to make decisions its leaders probably never thought they would have to contemplate.

Should schools stay open or closed? Which businesses are safe enough to operate? Should public transport still be running?

These questions are being considered daily — and the answers seem to be changing faster than most can keep up with.

But, in a world of uncertainty, messaging matters and clarity is key.

Today, Canberra families are adapting to the first day of a new education reality, hopefully all now having decided whether their kids are going to school.

But the ACT Government acknowledged that it made that decision-making process much more confusing than it needed to.

""I think we all recognise, in light of what happened late [on Sunday night], in terms of a sense of confused messaging, that we can and should do better,"" Chief Minister Andrew Barr said yesterday afternoon.

""And we will.""

Parents issued conflicting messages

The decision to move to ""pupil-free days"" from today was first announced late on Sunday afternoon, over a livestream on social media.

It was made in the wake of the news a Lyneham High School student had tested positive for COVID-19.

ACT COVID-19 snapshot Confirmed cases so far: 39

Tested negative: 2,780 Latest information from ACT Health

Education Minister Yvette Berry was initially quite clear.

""What that means is that no students will be coming to school,"" she said.

But reasonably quickly, it became apparent that things were not that straightforward.

""Schools are not closing"", Ms Berry declared.

They would simply operate without students, she said, as teachers prepared to take classes online from next term. But exceptions would be made for children whose parents delivered ""essential services"".

Then, just hours later, the Prime Minister declared schools would remain open across the country.

By Monday morning, authorities were saying that essential workers (hospital staff, teachers and other, as yet undefined, employees) could drop their children to school on Tuesday knowing they would be taken care of.

Meanwhile parents were being told in emails from some school authorities, ""your child cannot attend school during the pupil-free period"".

After 24 hours and multiple statements, today's position was arrived at: students should stay home if possible, but all are welcome to attend school if their parents cannot make alternative arrangements.

The end result is a near-identical position to that of neighbouring New South Wales and likely a relief for many parents — now free to choose the option that best suits their unique circumstance.

Like the Chief Minister, Ms Berry also acknowledged things could have been better communicated.

""I understand there's been some unfortunate messaging from the school community and I'm seeking to clarify that right now,"" she said.

Leaders are scrambling to make major decisions

At the heart of this confusion is a plain fact: Governments around Australia are moving quickly to respond to a threat that doubles in size every few days.

It's unreasonable to expect that every 'i' will be dotted and every 't' crossed amid rapid responses to the coronavirus pandemic.

Decisions are being made in hours, that would normally be sweated on for months, even years.

And the messy response was not entirely of the ACT Government's making, either.

It is trying to delicately balance the needs of the territory, with a desire for uniformity with changes being made in New South Wales.

Mr Barr also now has a seat at the most important table in the country, the National Cabinet, which carries a whole different set of complex responsibilities.

But with the acknowledgement of mistakes made comes a sign, hopefully, that clear communication will be a new priority, in these most confusing days.

You have more power than you might think,2020-03-23 19:06:53+11,1584990413,"Coronavirus has hit small businesses around Australia. Here's how you can help

Updated

We're all feeling the effects of coronavirus right now, especially with the way that we shop and pay for goods and services.

These changes are clearly taking a toll on many small businesses, who rely on the revenue from their regular customers to pay for staff, rent and even stock.

Some are already closing their doors for good.

The Federal Government's latest economic stimulus package includes cash payments of up to $100,000 for small businesses to try to keep them afloat and banks have announced a pause on repayments for small business loans.

But in what small way can we, as individuals, also help?

How can we support our favourite store, café or hairdresser while we're socially distancing?

Go online or pick up the phone

It sounds basic, right?

Put simply, your local store needs you, according to the Small Business Council of Australia.

""Let's make sure that when we come out of this, the community looks the same as it did on the way in,"" spokesman Peter Strong said.

With many states opting to shut down non-essential services, quite a few small businesses are adapting by offering online delivery services for the first time.

In Brisbane, cafe co-owner Priscilla Williams has started offering home delivery — a service that hadn't even been on her radar a few weeks ago.

Like some other cafes, she has begun taking payment over the phone and drops the meals, which can be frozen for later if needed, at people's front doors.

""We're really not trying to make money off it, we're just trying to keep staff employed,"" said Ms Williams, who owns two cafes and employs a dozen staff.

Other businesses are changing up what they offer.

Flowers aren't exactly in high demand right now, so Melbourne florist Victoria Whitelaw took a sideways step into fresh produce boxes, delivered without any contact with customers.

The boxes have fruit and vegetables from Melbourne's markets and some include produce from other Victorian businesses.

""I've got 23 full-time staff. On Monday morning I thought, 'oh my gosh, we've lost all of our big events, weddings',"" she said.

""We've had 40,000 views on Facebook already.

""We'll just keep doing it for as long as we can; people might want to keep buying it afterwards, who knows.""

Some customers feel so passionate about their local shops that they're setting up crowdfunding pages to keep them in business, says associate professor of marketing Nichola Roberston, from Deakin Business School.

""I really think the choices we make as customers now have the potential to really meaningfully help those that need it,"" she said.

Others are buying gift vouchers to use later — a way to help operators now. But you've got to be prepared to lose your money if the small business goes under.

Not everything costs money

If you're personally looking at some lean months ahead, there are still ways you can help out without spending your cash.

For a start, Dr Robertson says simply being more understanding when things go wrong.

""We need to be more tolerant if things fail. Expecting a more adequate service level rather than their desired service level, because we're all in unprecedented times,"" she said.

""A good online review is uplifting for the owner,"" added Mr Strong.

""It's letting people know you do value them, that you really want them to stay open.""

And it's even better to spread positive vibes on social media, Dr Robertson says.

""Telling others what the business is actually doing to keep its customers safe and healthy if they're taking precautions … people can help by liking these sort of posts, commenting, sharing and following,"" she said.

Johann Kim, a founder and managing director of a giftware store, says social media encouragement can help business owners stay positive in dark times.

""It really is so important to know that others actually care,"" he said.

Dr Robertson says customers can even go a step further and give their favourite stores ideas of how they can help in this situation.

""For instance, what does the customer currently feel uncomfortable about and could the business potentially adapt?"" she said.

She also says customers can offer more practical help.

""They might be short staffed, for example, so could you do anything to help, almost like being a partial employee for that business?"" she suggested.

Ms Williams said the community spirit, particularly in her suburban store, was helping.

""We keep saying 'we are stronger together'. I think I even saw someone make a badge out of that,"" she said.

""I can't imagine everyone would be able to afford to eat out every day, but maybe they buy from us where they can.""

Updated

Another federal politician has tested positive for coronavirus, with South Australian senator Rex Patrick confirming he is the fourth politician to be infected.

Key points: The Centre Alliance senator was confirmed to have coronavirus

He has been in self-isolation since last Tuesday

Senator Patrick is working with authorities to advise anyone he has been in contact with

The Centre Alliance MP has been in self-isolation since coming into contact with Liberal senator Andrew Bragg, who recently returned a positive test.

It comes as the number of cases in South Australia is confirmed to have jumped by 34 in the past 24 hours, taking the total to 134 — the biggest one-day jump so far.

More than 50 police officers are currently in self-isolation as testing is carried out, but none has tested positive.

Senator Patrick has said he has no symptoms but, after being tested at a drive-thru clinic, SA Health has confirmed he does have the virus.

He said he was working with authorities to help them work out who he had been in contact with.

""I haven't got any symptoms, I haven't had any symptoms for the entire 15 days since I've been in contact with Andrew Bragg,"" he said.

""During that time I met with local mayors, I met with politicians, I did a Press Club function.

""I don't actually know how many people SA Health will put into isolation … I will be medically assessed and at some stage I will have to go through two negative tests before I'm allowed out my apartment.""

In an earlier tweet, Senator Patrick advised ""anyone concerned about contact with me can ring 1800 020 080"".

In addition to Senators Patrick and Bragg, Queensland LNP senator Susan McDonald was also confirmed to have the virus.

Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton was the first federal MP to be diagnosed but has since been discharged from hospital.

Senator Patrick entered self-isolation on Tuesday last week, after Senator Bragg's positive diagnosis was confirmed.

At the time, Senator Patrick said he had last come into contact with Senator Bragg at a Senate inquiry nine days earlier.

SA cases increase by a third in past day

SA's chief public health officer Dr Nicola Spurrier on Monday confirmed the total number of cases in South Australia had increased by about a third in the past 24 hours.

""Similarly to yesterday, the individuals range in age from people in their 20s right through to people in their 70s,"" she said.

""At this stage I can still confirm that from all of the people that have been interviewed thus far there still is either a link to a known case, overseas travel or interstate travel.""

Dr Spurrier said there had not been any admissions into intensive care, but cruise ship passengers had been among the latest cases.

""In particular, you may be aware of the Ruby Princess and also the Ovation of the Sea, both cruise ships, and we have had a number of cases confirmed of people that had travelled on those cruise liners that had made their way back to South Australia,"" she said.

""We were told from the national incident room that there was approximately 200 people in South Australia that had come from the Ruby Princess.

""My team sent emails and SMS messages to all those people on Saturday night.""

SA Police Commissioner Grant Stevens warned the public that officers had expanded powers to detain people who did not comply with coronavirus quarantine orders.

He said dozens of police were themselves currently in self-isolation.

""We currently have about 55 police officers who are subject to self-isolation and a number of those have been tested but at this point in time no police officers or police staff have tested positive to COVID-19,"" Commissioner Stevens said.

The SA Government yesterday imposed tougher restrictions on public movements and gatherings — including closing the state's borders, with some exceptions.

Dr Spurrier also expressed support for the new measures, saying it would help lower the number of confirmed cases.

""I believe this is the right thing to do, we are moving nationally on this, we need to slow the time it takes for this disease to get to Australia and to dampen down the curve to ensure that our health services are able to cope,"" she said.

""I am certainly hoping the numbers are not going to be increasing exponentially.""

Dr Spurrier said SA Pathology had performed 17,100 tests to date in the state and the turnaround time was about 30 hours.

Updated

The ACT has recorded 12 new cases of COVID-19 in just under 24 hours, after the number of cases more than doubled on Sunday.

ACT Chief Medical Officer Kerry Coleman said three of the now 32 confirmed cases, who are aged between 14 and 83 years old, are in hospital.

Five of the new cases are linked to the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which docked in Sydney last week.

One student, from Lyneham High School, is among the 32 confirmed cases.

All ACT schools will become ""pupil-free"" from Tuesday to give teachers time to deal with the outbreak and move to an online teaching model.

Tested negative: 2,780 Latest information from ACT Health

Reacting to the latest numbers, Chief Minister Andrew Barr foreshadowed more crackdowns on people's freedoms if measures to close many ""non-essential"" services failed to slow the virus's spread.

""We may have to go harder in the future,"" he said.

""This is the toughest experience that most of us will go through in our lives.""

Mr Barr said Canberrans needed to do more to keep their distance from others in the community.

""Clearly people were too close to each other, and that's why we have brought in these measures,"" he said.

But Dr Coleman also said he she all the cases were either people who had recently travelled overseas or who had come into close contact with a known case.

As a result of the increase in transmissions, it was also announced that from 5:00pm on Monday, visits to aged care facilities would be restricted, except for staff at those facilities.

The new restriction means family members will only be able to visit those in aged care homes at certain times, and in limited numbers.

Health Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith said these measures had been brought in to protect the most vulnerable in society.

""Visitors will be restricted to care and support visits, limited to one per day of no longer than two hours, of one person or two people together,"" Ms Stephen-Smith said.

Those under the age of 16 will only be able to visit for compassionate reasons.

'No child will be turned away'

Mr Barr said that while the Government was encouraging parents to keep students at home if possible, ACT schools were ""safe"".

Education Minister Yvette Berry admitted there had been confusion in the past 24 hours about whether schools were open to their pupils or not.

""Yes, I understand that there has been some unfortunate messaging from the school community and I am seeking to clarify that message now,"" she said.

She said they had sent out a library resource to those parents home-schooling their children, as staff prepared a strategy for alternative types of teaching in the weeks to come.

""No child will be turned away from our schools if parents decide they need to send them to school,"" she said.

She added that the Department of Education was also working with families to identify students who did not have the right set-up at home for online learning.

""We're working with the schools to identify where there might be improvements to equity to ensure that students that don't have access to devices or don't have access to the internet, to provide those devices,"" she said.

""And of course education will be age appropriate for those students.""

While Lyneham High School was closed due to the infected pupil, about 40 per cent of ACT students had turned up to school on Monday morning, Ms Berry said.

She said teaching staff were optimistic about the new approach to learning that was taking shape.

""I have complete confidence in the teaching profession — learning doesn't always happen in the school,"" she said.

""We know that students can thrive with other methods and staff are developing those methods now.""

Updated

In a surprise announcement yesterday afternoon, the ACT Government announced all Canberra schools would be going ""pupil-free"" from Tuesday, giving teachers time to make arrangements as the outbreak of coronavirus stretches into term two.

To complicate matters, the Government insisted that did not mean schools were closing, and later that evening Prime Minister Scott Morrison declared schools should remain open this week around the country, but parents have the right to keep their kids at home.

It's a fast moving situation, with the Victorian Government bringing forward school holidays to Tuesday, and the NSW Government urging parents not to send their kids to school.

Here's what the ACT's announcement means for Canberra families.

So are Canberra schools closed?

Not really, but that doesn't mean students should attend.

The ACT Government says most students should stay home from Tuesday onwards — this applies to both government and non-government schools.

But exceptions will be made for students whose parents are ""essential"" workers. Those parents will be notified of arrangements today.

Chief Minister Andrew Barr strongly urged parents to keep their kids at home, but said any children that did turn up at school would not be turned away.

""The schools are open today in order for some very practical things to occur — for students to be able to collect the items they will need to manage their distant online education for the rest of the year,"" he said.

""Kids who need to be at school because there are no other options will not be turned away and will be looked after. But we are asking parents who can keep their kids at home to do so.""

The Government is stressing that schools are not going pupil-free because of immediate health concerns, but to give teachers time to prepare alternative learning arrangements — like much more online interactive content — from when term two begins in five weeks' time.

""Essentially schools will continue to operate but students don't attend,"" Education Directorate deputy director David Matthews said.

ACT COVID-19 snapshot Confirmed cases so far: 39

Tested negative: 2,780 Latest information from ACT Health

He says schools are working to supply learning materials that pupils can complete from home this week, with a view to implement alternative teaching arrangements from term two onwards.

""The ACT is digitally aware and able to move to online education,"" Education Minister Yvette Berry said on Monday.

Have ACT schools been exposed to COVID-19?

The only Canberra school closed today is Lyneham High, which is attended by a student who has tested positive for the virus.

This is to allow contact tracing to be done for the student, who attended school on Tuesday last week, when they may have been infectious.

Lyneham High is also being thoroughly cleaned today.

It is the only one of the ACT's 20 confirmed COVID-19 cases linked to a school.

So who should send their kids to school?

Mr Barr says ACT public schools will still be able to safely receive and provide learning for the children of parents and carers engaged in essential services, as well as vulnerable children and those with additional needs.

""No child will be turned away from school,"" he said.

Mr Matthews said the Government had contacted parents deemed essential workers on Monday, to ensure their children could still attend school.

""That includes our healthcare workforce, and of course our teachers that will be working,"" he said.

""There are also vulnerable students in the community as well that we care deeply about, so we'll be making arrangements for them as well.

""The arrangements will initially be that the children will go back to their normal school.""

What about childcare centres and universities?

As of the moment the Government will not be requiring childcare centres to close.

""We'll be working with the childcare industry to help them through this process,"" Mr Matthews said.

From next week, the Australian National University will deliver courses online where possible.

For lab classes and other courses that require in-person attendance, social distancing will be enforced.

The University of Canberra will continue with classes until Friday, when its mid-semester break begins.

Updated

While suburbs face the prospect of being locked down in a bid to curtail the spread of the deadly virus, federal politicians are travelling from across the country to Canberra for an extraordinary one-day sitting of the Federal Parliament.

It leads to the question: why are they doing so when the rest of the nation is being urged to hunker down?

The simple answer is the Government needs to pass legislation in order for it to spend the billions of dollars in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

The legislation that needs to be dealt with includes the urgent coronavirus economic stimulus bills designed to keep the nation financially afloat and help the most needy.

Who will be coming to Canberra?

There are 227 federal politicians that sit in the Parliament, across two chambers.

Of those, 129 politicians must be present in Parliament House for the House of Representative and Senate to function.

That means almost half of the Parliament has been excused to limit the number of people needing to travel to the nation's capital.

Will the 129 sit all day?

In short, no.

To deal with any business, the Parliament needs a quorum, which is 31 MPs in the Lower House and 19 senators in the Upper House.

But if there are any votes on legislation, or attempts to change the day's schedule, all the politicians present at Parliament House will rush into the chambers.

If a division is called for a vote to change the proceedings, a minimum of 76 people will be required in the House of Representatives and 39 in the Senate in some circumstances.

The Government insists those within the chambers will adhere to social distancing guidelines at all times.

It's even possible there may not be any votes.

That's because the major parties have signalled they are in agreement about the economic package.

Instead, the legislation could pass ""on the voices"" if no-one yells out ""nay"" when asked if those present agree to the measures before the Parliament.

This can all happen because of ""pairing"" arrangements that allow two MPs or senators from opposite sides to agree they will be absent and their votes can cancel each other out if required.

Which politicians will have to come to Canberra?

Any politician who is self-isolating will get a leave pass.

Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton has been discharged from hospital and is planning to attend if he gets a clean bill of health.

There are two other senators who have been confirmed to have coronavirus, Queensland LNP senator Susan McDonald and NSW Liberal senator Andrew Bragg. They won't be there.

Anyone travelling from a remote community, or facing a long journey to get to Canberra, will be able to skip attending.

Other members of Parliament with a compromised immune system will also be able to stay home.

Greens Senator Jordan Steele-John, who uses a wheelchair and has cerebral palsy, is staying away after getting medical advice.

Crossbenchers are mixed in their approach. Senators Jacqui Lambie and One Nation leader Pauline Hanson don't plan to come. But two of Centre Alliance's three politicians will attend.

Will it just be politicians at Parliament House?

In a full parliamentary sitting week, it's estimated there are up to 5,000 people hurrying to work and meet inside the Federal Parliament.

But there won't be much of the usual hustle and bustle. MPs are only bringing essential staff.

Former parliamentarians, most lobbyists and volunteers won't be able to come in to restricted areas even if they have a pass to access the building.

The usual stream of school excursions have been cancelled or postponed.

Even the Parliament's eateries will be putting in measures to limit handling of food and seating spread out to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Why can't politicians work from home?

Government backbencher Barnaby Joyce has wondered why can't the Parliament go virtual and allow politicians to ""hit yay or nay from their office?""

According to the clerk of the House of Representatives, Claressa Surtees, it's pretty simple, and outlined in the foundation document of the nation — the constitution.

She points out that Section 39 of the constitution refers to the need for the ""presence"" of a fifth of the Parliament for a quorum to validate any decisions that are made.

""This requirement has always been interpreted as meaning that 'the presence' means physical presence,"" the clerk said.

In advocating for a virtual Parliament, Mr Joyce gave a warning of the consequences of it going ahead like normal.

""Parliament is designed to spread COVID-19. Politicians touch hundreds of hands then jump in a plane and fly to boarding school in Canberra,"" he said in a statement to Channel Ten.

""Then after that take what has been picked up in that process, jump back on a plane and fly to every corner of Australia.""

The May budget has been postponed until October now, so it's unclear how many months might pass before politicians are back in Canberra again.

Will we see the usual political blow-ups?

The Parliament is only expected to sit for a single day, as politicians work to pass the laws and get home to their electorates.

The only matter listed on the agenda is ""urgent stimulus package and other immediate business"".

The Parliament will practise social distancing, meaning politicians will be spaced out across the usually crammed leather benches.

And don't expect the usual raucous questioning and sledging of Question Time.

It will go ahead with the minimum number of people required to ask and answer the questions.

There won't be anyone in the public gallery for Question Time either. There will be fewer attendants in the chambers, and the usual practice of handing around glasses of water is likely to be canned.

The Parliament's cleaners will have the antiseptic spray in the quick-draw holster, particularly on the doors and other surfaces that many people touch and at the building's security gates where hundreds of people come in and out of the building for work each day.

Updated

The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canberra has jumped from nine to 20 over the past day, prompting the ACT Government to move to shutdown non-essential services and introduce ""pupil-free"" schools from Tuesday.

Key points: Over the next two days non-essential services will be closed across the ACT

All ACT schools will move to ""pupil-free days"" from Tuesday

The ACT Government says it would be ""impossible"" for the territory to have rules different to NSW

The ACT's chief health officer, Kerryn Coleman, said on Sunday afternoon that 10 Canberrans had been confirmed as newly infected — seven men and three women aged between 21 and 67.

Hours later she announced that one more case had been identified — a student from Lyneham High School.

Dr Coleman said the student had been to school on Tuesday last week while they may have been infectious.

She said Lyneham High School would be closed on today as a result while the school was cleaned and while ACT Health could conduct ""contact tracing"".

All other ACT schools will remain open for today.

However, Education Minister Yvette Berry said all ACT schools — government and private — will move to ""pupil-free"" days from Tuesday until the beginning of the school holidays.

Ms Berry said teachers and staff would still be at the schools, ""preparing to move to a different kind of learning"".

This will provide schools and teachers with time to prepare for a range of learning delivery options, including online, similar to how distance education is provided in remote areas,"" she said.

""The ACT is digitally aware and able to move to online education.""

Ms Berry said face-to-face learning would still be available to children who need it, however did not clarify how those children would be defined.

She said more information would be available on Monday.

ACT to shutdown non-essential services over the next 48 hours

In the wake of the new numbers, Chief Minister Andrew Barr said the ACT would follow Victoria and New South Wales in moving to shut down non-essential services over the next 48 hours.

On Monday morning, Mr Barr said the closure would be in line with measures announced by the Prime Minister following the meeting of National Cabinet.

Mr Barr said despite measures to discourage social interaction, there were still too many instances where people were exposing themselves to contracting the virus.

""We must also face the reality that, as a territory within NSW, it would be impossible for the ACT to have different arrangements than those in our surrounding region,"" he said.

""We will ensure that Canberrans continue to have access to the services they need — supermarkets, petrol stations, banks, pharmacies, post offices and convenience stores.

""Freight and logistics will also be considered as an essential service. Over the next 48 hours, we will define these essential services and work closely with retailers on their requirements.""

Canberrans urged not to leave Canberra region

Earlier on Sunday, Mr Barr urged all Canberrans to avoid all non-essential travel.

""The only travel outside of the Canberra region should be for work, for compassionate reasons, and to ensure the essential supplies and services that our region needs,"" he said.

""This means no holidays on the south coast this Easter or school holidays, it means no weekends in Sydney or Melbourne.

""Visiting family and friends outside of the Canberra region needs to be carefully considered, and if it is not essential, don't do it.""

Updated

The Warriors have continued life on the road with a loss to the Raiders on the Gold Coast, while Melbourne got past Cronulla and Manly kept the Sydney Roosters winless in their NRL premiership defence.

Warriors fall to Raiders during Aussie road trip

A tough week only worsened for a gutsy Warriors outfit after they lost 20-6 to Canberra in their relocated match at the Gold Coast's empty home stadium in Robina.

New Zealand's Warriors agreed on Friday to stay in Australia and continue playing for as long as the competition continued — while they are away from their families — amid the coronavirus pandemic.

But the Raiders were not interested in showing mercy, piling on three second-half tries to clinch a second-straight win before flying back to the nation's capital in a hit-and-run Gold Coast visit.

The Warriors slumped to a 0-2 season start for the first time since 2016.

Boosted by the injury returns of star trio, Jarrod Croker, Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad and Josh Hodgson, the Raiders soaked up the Queensland heat to jump to a 2-0 season start for just the second time since the 2006 season.

Stay up-to-date on the coronavirus outbreak Download the ABC News app and subscribe to our range of news alerts for the latest on how the pandemic is impacting the world

But the Raiders did not have it all their own way against a Warriors side who tried to put a nightmare lead-up behind them.

They faced an uncertain future after the New Zealand Government announced all arrivals into the country would be required to undergo a 14-day self-isolation period.

The ruling left the Warriors needing to remain in Australia after their 20-0 round-one loss to Newcastle or drop out and leave the competition with 15 teams.

Australia's new border laws, which kicked in from Friday night, prevented non-citizens entering the country and residents returning (without 14 days' isolation) during the coronavirus pandemic, effectively locking out numerous families.

Warriors officials initially believed that could spell the end of the team's time in Australia, but the players met on Friday and decided they were in for the long haul despite facing the prospect of staying away from their families indefinitely.

The Warriors started the match full of intent, with Lachlan Burr crossing after Croker spilt a kick in the seventh minute only for the video referee to disallow the try, ruling the Raiders skipper had been tackled in the air.

The Raiders finally managed to get on top to lead 6-0 at half-time after a scrappy first term.

They led 16-0 early in the second half, however the Warriors showed plenty of character to stay in the fight and finally had a break in the 75th minute when Kodi Nikorima was awarded a penalty try after George Williams obstructed the try-bound utility.

Storm score late win over Sharks

Melbourne and Cronulla returned to their gritty best, as the Storm ground out a 12-10 win at Kogarah Jubilee Stadium.

The Sharks led 4-2 at half-time and the match did not come alive until the final 20 minutes.

A converted Tui Kamikamica try next to the posts in the 71st minute levelled the scores at 10-10 to set up a tense finish.

And with just four minutes on the clock, talented Sharks utility Billy Magoulias gave away a penalty and Cameron Smith calmly kicked between the sticks to make sure the Storm remain unbeaten from two matches this season.

Both teams had slotted two penalty goals, before Magoulias broke the match open after a dogfight throughout the first 60 minutes.

Harking back to the traditional arm-wrestle battles between the two clubs, scores were locked at 4-4 when Sharks full-back Will Kennedy found some space around the ruck and made a break through the middle of the field.

Kennedy was brought down within a few metres of Storm's line and in the next play, dummy half Blayke Brailey's grubber kick found Magoulias next to the posts for the first try of the contest.

It was also the first try the Storm had conceded this season after holding out Manly at Brookvale Oval in round one.

Cherry-Evans ices Sea Eagles' win over Roosters

Daly Cherry-Evans reasserted his status as the NRL's coolest head under pressure to help Manly to a clutch 9-8 win over the Sydney Roosters at Leichhardt Oval.

In a high-quality match played in front of around 25 people watching from neighbouring roofs and a nearby scaffold, Cherry-Evans won the contest for the Sea Eagles with just four minutes left on the clock.

The result gave the Roosters the worst start to a season by a defending premier in 11 years, as they went 0-2 after also losing last week to Penrith.

The Roosters had dominated the territorial battle all match, with Manly getting just eight tackles inside its 20-metre zone.

The Roosters also had their chance to win the match, when a Luke Keary field goal shot from right in front swung into the left-hand upright.

But the match swung late when Lachlan Croker crunched James Tedesco in a tackle, forcing an error from the Roosters full-back.

Manly worked it down the middle from the ensuing set, before Cherry-Evans iced the match.

It marked the 21st field goal of Cherry-Evans's career, the most of any current player in the competition.

The ACT Health Minister has praised the actions of three Canberrans newly diagnosed with COVID-19, saying each of them followed guidelines to minimise their transmission to others.

Key points: All three new cases had recently travelled overseas

Canberra's jail will suspend visits to inmates to slow the virus's spread

There are now nine confirmed cases of coronavirus in the ACT

But a search is still underway for people who may have come into contact with the infected people, including on Canberra-bound flights.

The cases, a man in his 70s and two women in their 50s and 60s, all recently returned from overseas travel and went into self-imposed isolation.

The announcement of three new positive results is the largest jump in COVID-19 cases in Canberra so far, bringing the total to nine.

ACT Health is now working on reaching the close contacts of the three, including passengers on flights used by two of the new cases while they may have been infectious.

The third case was not believed to have been infectious while she was travelling.

Authorities are looking to contact people sitting on rows 79 to 83 on flight QR908 from Doha to Sydney, which arrived on Tuesday March 17, and rows 12 to 16 on flight VA672 from Sydney to Canberra, landing at 9:30pm on the same day

They are also looking into whether passengers on flight QR906 from Doha to Canberra on Monday March 16 could have been exposed to the virus, though were yet to determine the infectious person's seat number on the flight.

The two women remain at home in isolation, while the man has been admitted to hospital.

Prison visits halted to stop virus spread

Health Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith said all three new cases had ""done the right thing"" by self-isolating to limit their contact with other people.

""It's an important reminder to those people who may have returned from overseas and are wondering whether they really do need to self-quarantine — yes you do,"" she said.

The ACT Government has also cancelled visits to Canberra's jail from Monday, in an effort to prevent the virus from spreading inside.

ACT Corrective Services Commissioner Jon Peach said one prisoner at the Alexander Maconochie Centre had been tested for coronavirus after exhibiting flu-like symptoms, but they had returned a negative result.

""We have to make sure that people put into the centre are protected … from the potential spread and we have to limit the number of people actually entering the jail,"" Mr Peach said.

""We have a number of prisoners that are obviously concerned about the virus, we've also got a number of prisoners that really, really want to see their families.

""We are working very very hard to ensure that there are opportunities for detainees to maintain those family ties, which would [include] increased access to telephones.""

In the ACT, more than 2,200 people have been tested for COVID-19.

Yesterday, the ACT Government released details of a stimulus package aimed at helping the territory to weather the economic storm the coronavirus outbreak has brought.

It includes a $150 rebate on bills for every household, credit for businesses and cash payments to public housing tenants.

Farmers markets allowed to go ahead amid social distancing

While several events in Canberra have been postponed or cancelled in the wake of the pandemic, farmers markets were allowed to go ahead over the weekend, as they are classified as an essential service.

Sarah Power, the manager at the Capital Region Farmers' Market, said staff had worked hard to accommodate for social distancing requirements.

""We've taken out all tables and chairs, removed them entirely, so that we are encouraging social distancing,"" she said.

""We've also spread the majority of our stalls out as much as we can so that allows people to distance themselves.""

Food sampling has also been scrapped, but Ms Power said there had been no need to institute purchase limits on goods, as major supermarkets had done in response to panic buying.

""We are certainly up in terms of a lot of people but it's calm, it's orderly, people are forming lines and every one is really just happy to be here,"" she said.

Updated

With so much seemingly conflicting coronavirus information swirling around social media, and the internet more broadly, it can be hard to know what — or who — to trust.

But, it is probably safe to say medical advice from your real estate agent should not be the first port of call.

Key points: A letter downplaying COVID-19 was sent to thousands of Canberra residents

It suggested vitamins and home remedies while calling the virus the ""common cold""

The real estate agent later retracted the letter, apologising for upsetting people

Medical authorities are urging the community to look to official health department websites, and their GPs, for information on how to protect themselves from COVID-19, and manage the virus should they contract it.

It comes after a seven-page document calling for more ""common sense"" in the medical approach to coronavirus was sent to landlords and tenants across the ACT, by their real estate agent.

Document claims coronavirus is 'common cold'

Maloney's Real Estate in Canberra sent the email to their clients this week, suggesting there was a lot of ""hysteria"" around, and the document could help by providing a ""good understanding of the issues we face"".

The document, authored by Canberra naturopath and immunobiologist Bill Giles, suggests the virus is simply ""an everyday common cold virus"".

""If you are not old (above 70 years of age) and do not have a compromised immune system, then you are not in any real danger — this is common sense,"" the letter read.

But president of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) in the ACT, Dr Antonio Di Dio, said the document offered false reassurance to the community.

""This is far from common sense, this is absolutely dangerous,"" he said.

""A simple review of the graph that is published every day on the state and federal government websites, and around the world, shows that some of the most dangerous cases are being covered by people under the age of 70.

""And there are deaths in people under the age of 70 — people need to be careful.""

The document suggested a range of homeopathic medicines, vitamins — like vitamin C and magnesium — and a grain-free diet to protect against the virus.

It suggested brushing teeth, flossing and using a hydrogen-peroxide mouthwash ""to destroy coronarviruses in your mouth"", and rinsing with colloidal silver.

Once the virus hit, it suggested less than 10ml of brandy every three to four hours during the day, along with sleep and various other medicines and therapies.

Dr Di Dio said the suggestions might not do harm in and of themselves, but they could provide a false sense of security.

""I don't think there's enough evidence at all to suggest that it's going to do any good,"" he said.

""I don't want to disrespect or criticise any other person's manner of practicing however they choose to practice.

""But I do have the greatest concerns for someone who offers reassurance, when that reassurance is offered falsely.""

The email from Maloney's was retracted within an hour, along with an apology noting ""sending out medical information is not my role as a real estate agent, and it may contradict mainstream medical advice"".

Peter Maloney did not want to offer any further comment when asked by the ABC.

'This pandemic is so important': Doctors urge community to look to official channels

When contacted by the ABC, Mr Giles said he was not a medical doctor, but had three degrees in science from the University of Queensland and Australian National University.

He said he had been a clinical biologist for more than three decades, specialising in immune-related illnesses.

And while the document included multiple false claims, it also suggested washing hands and avoiding other people — advice being given by health authorities to stop the spread of the virus.

When asked about the criticisms of his work, Mr Giles said the broader medical community was not providing enough advice to those concerned about the virus.

""I think these criticisms are coming from people who probably have 'conformation bias', and have not investigated/studied to any depth, anything outside their medical training/organisation,"" he said.

""Calling the suggestions in that blog 'absolutely dangerous' is incredibly narrow-minded.""

But Dr Di Dio said the attitude taken by Mr Giles highlighted the problems medical authorities faced in trying to communicate the best possible information to an anxious public.

""I do urge all Australians, all Canberrans, to seek information from a trusted source — the Chief Health Officer, state and federal Chief Health Officers and chief authorities, their websites and your local GP,"" he said.

""Please, please, please look at all the responsible data and look at the recommendations that are evolving every single day from our trusted and senior health authorities,"" Dr Di Dio said.

""This pandemic is so important and so potentially serious.""

Separating fact from the COVID-19 rumour mill

The trouble with sourcing the right information is further complicated when rumours swirl of looming announcements of total societal shutdowns, and a need to ""stock up on supplies"".

In the days leading up to this week's announcements on restrictions around mass gatherings, text messages with seemingly significant information were sent out, often attributed to high-level government sources.

""So heard from a speechwriter for sco-mo that they may be annoying (sic) a state of emergency either tonight or tomorrow,"" one read. ""So if there is a time to do some panic buying it's now as the supermarkets are only going to get worse. ""Not confirmed but the speech has been written!""

Other text messages sent by anonymous sources have warned of nationwide lockdowns, including by sending a copy of an announcement made by authorities in Malaysia earlier this week, incorrectly attributed to Australia.

""My husband just got a phone call from his cousin that is a dr at RPA and St Vincents,"" another read. ""Just a heads up, this coming week the government is putting a lock down on schools and wants everyone to isolate indefinitely till there isn't many cases. ""It's recommended to go buy all essentials ASAP. Only certain things will be left open…""

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has previously indicated a frustration with ""gossip and nonsense"" urging the community to listen to the facts, as communicated through proper channels.

When contacted about this issue, ACT Health instructed Canberrans to visit their website ""for the best advice on how to best protect themselves and to reduce the spread of COVID-19"".

""For general information on COVID-19 people can call the Coronavirus Health Information Line on 1800 020 080.

""For individual advice people should consult with their health practitioner.""

Updated

Cash for public housing tenants, rates rebates, suspended fees and funding for arts and entertainment businesses are just some of the components of a wide-ranging stimulus package the ACT Government announced on Friday.

Key points: A $137m stimulus package will target vulnerable households and small businesses in Canberra

Chief Minister Andrew Barr says it is likely the first of several stimulus packages to come

Arts and entertainment industries will also receive dedicated support through the plan



Chief Minister Andrew Barr said this first package would be one of many during the course of the pandemic.

It was unveiled just as two more cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in the ACT.

""There will be more to come, there will need to be more to come,"" Mr Barr said of the stimulus package.

""There will be a second, most likely a third and possibly even a fourth over the coming 12 months.""

Among the initiatives are a $150 rebate on rates bills for every household and a $2,622 credit for businesses, a $250 cash payment to public housing tenants, a $20 million fund for contractors to undertake simple works on government assets, and $500,000 in arts grant funding.

A further decision was made to postpone the ACT budget, in line with the Federal Government and the other states and territories.

In accounting for the postponement, the ACT Government said it was ""not possible to develop and set out fiscal and economic strategies for the full year.""

But the Government said the move would not impact on the ongoing delivery of Government services, or the Government's ability to pay its staff.

ACT records two more cases — bringing the territory's total to six

Two men who had recently travelled overseas were identified as the ACT's fifth and sixth cases of COVID-19.

ACT Health said the fifth case was a man in his 70s, while the sixth was aged in his 50s.

People who sat in certain rows in close proximity to the fifth case were asked to call the Communicable Disease Control Section of ACT Health on (02) 5124 9213.

They are:

People in rows 42-46 on Flight EY450 from Abu Dhabi to Sydney, which arrived at 6:00am on March 18.

People in rows 3-7 on Flight VA640 from Sydney to Canberra, arriving at 11:00am on March 18.

Others who travelled on these flights were asked to monitor their health, but were not required to contact ACT Health.

ACT Health Chief Health Officer Dr Kerryn Coleman said the sixth case was not considered to have had any close travel contacts, due to his specific travel arrangements.

Both men, along with their close household contacts, were self-quarantining, Dr Coleman said.

The Australian National University also confirmed one of its interstate students had been diagnosed with the virus, and was being treated.

Meanwhile, Health Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith said 81 people had been tested for coronavirus at the newly opened drive-through assessment centre at EPIC Park since Friday morning.

She said 150 people who arrived at the centre to be tested were turned away because they did not meet the criteria for testing.

""I'm advised that the drive-through respiratory centre is working well, with minimal waits,"" she said.

So what's in the ACT Government's coronavirus stimulus package?

In a press conference on Friday, Mr Barr said the stimulus package was designed to complement the Federal Government's, with a focus on the sectors most affected by coronavirus.

""Some are obviously booming, many are not ... we don't need to be giving tax relief to supermarkets at the moment,"" he said.

Here is a breakdown of what you can expect:

Households

$150 rates rebate for every household

$200 rebate to households receiving the utilities concession

Vehicle registration, public transport ticketing and parking fees to be frozen at current levels



Businesses

$2,622 credit to commercial rates bill

$750 rebate to small businesses through their next electricity bill

Businesses that pay up to $10m in wages will be able to defer payroll tax for 12 months

Affected industries will receive a one-off six month waiver on payroll tax

Taxi and rideshare fees waived

Food and liquor licence fees waived

$20m fund for simple infrastructure works on public buildings

Funding for clubs to retain casual staff

Public sector staff in events or entertainment redeployed to maintenance works

Community

$500,000 in arts grant funding brought forward

$7m package for non-government organisations to meet increased demand for social services

Additional funding for Lifeline

'Dire' economic outlook prompts stimulus

Mr Barr said they had designed the package so that many changes to fees, rates and bills would be made automatically.

""A number of them roll out as quickly as possible, others are just automatically deducted in relation to future bills so people will know they won't have to contact us and it was just going to happen,"" he said.

""We're not in a position to field 170,000 phone calls from every rate paying household so we're applying these things automatically.""

He described the economic implications of the pandemic as ""dire"" and ""grim"", and likened the responses from various governments to war-time strategies.

""What we are looking to do is cushion that impact as much as we can,"" he said.

""But our efforts can only go so far, we understand that, I want people to know that from the start of this process.""

The Chief Minister singled out commercial landlords as having to join government and the banks in offering relief to those unable to make rent or pay bills during the crisis.

""Those conversations are taking place now at a national level with many of the large retail institutions, the Westfields and the like,"" Mr Barr said.

""That's going to have to extend now to many of the smaller landlords because they'll find that if they let tenants go, if they foreclose on them, there will be no tenants, there will be no income.""

Residential landlords were also strongly urged not to evict tenants who failed to make rent.

""Now is not the time to be evicting people — there will not be other tenants,"" Mr Barr said.

""I know many are already offering rent-free periods for their tenants to help them through this. That is to be encouraged and I thank those landlords.""

Canberrans have also been encouraged to support local businesses, where practical.

""If you decide to stay at home, you can still support local business through online activity,"" Mr Barr said.

""Many businesses have had most of their customer base just disappear in this last week, so now is the time for Canberrans, in a different way, to adapt, to innovate, but to support those local businesses.

""If we are kind to one another and we exercise our common sense we will get through it.""

'It's theft': Hospital staff told not to take masks, hand sanitiser

At the same press conference on Friday, Health Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith confirmed that staff at Canberra Hospital had been reprimanded after certain items had gone missing.

""My understanding is it's more like masks and hand sanitiser that has gone missing, but there are a number of items that people are considering that they may want for their own families,"" Ms Stephen-Smith said.

""This is property of Canberra Health Services and taking home items like masks and hand sanitiser is theft.""

Measures have been put in place to add extra security around items that have been going missing.

Is this the end of cash?,2020-03-19 20:11:43+11,1584648703,"Coronavirus fears mean shops are accepting card payments only. Is this the end of cash?

Updated

The coronavirus pandemic has spread to many aspects of life.

But one of its early and unexpected impacts seems to be on cash — or, more specifically, cash transactions.

Key points: Businesses are trying to protect their staff by preventing them from handling notes and coins

Cash is 'legal tender', but sellers are not breaking the law by refusing to accept it

The Reserve Bank says cash transactions are at historic lows, though many people like 'hoarding' it for emergencies

Though it does not reference cash specifically, Department of Health advice says the COVID-19 virus can spread through ""touching objects that have cough or sneeze droplets from an infected person"" on them.

So when managers of The Knox cafe, in suburban Canberra, met to discuss how to protect staff and improve hygiene, refusing coins and banknotes was one of their first decisions.

""We've stopped using keep cups and we've stopped cash transactions,"" front-of-house manager Madeleine Clarke said.

""Our boss wants us to minimise hand-to-hand interactions and, obviously, cash carries a lot of germs.""

Peter Barclay, who runs city pub King O'Malleys, has started to ask drinkers to do the same.

""Already, very few people use cash in the economy … it's probably 10 to 15 per cent of our patrons,"" he said.

""When they come to the bar, we just say, 'Look, do you have a credit card?'""

These cases are not isolated.

Merchants across the country are responding to the COVID-19 crisis by avoiding touching money.

Others, such as McDonald's restaurants, still accept coins and banknotes, but instruct staff to wear gloves while doing so.

A spokesperson for McDonald's said the chain had also advised employees how to give and take coins from customers in a way that minimised contact.

The NSW Government has also recently reminded businesses of the dangers of handling cash and, if it was required, suggested they use hand sanitisers.

Is it unlawful to refuse to accept cash?

There is a widespread belief that if you give a business ""legal tender"" — official Australian coins or banknotes — they must accept it as payment.

However, that is not what the law says. In fact, the Currency Act limits the buyer's rights to use physical money in certain situations.

For example, if you use silver coins (5c, 10c, 20c or 50c pieces) for a purchase worth more than $5, the seller can say no. Similarly, $2 coins only give you the right to buy a $20 good or service.

It is also legal for vending machines and parking meters to accept only certain denominations of currency.

The Reserve Bank of Australia says sellers are ""at liberty to set the commercial terms upon which payment will take place"" before the purchase ""and refusal to accept payment in legal tender banknotes and coins is not unlawful"".

A sign at a cafe counter does just that — it lays out the commercial terms before the customer orders.

The exception is when a purchase was agreed without first settling on how the payment would be made.

""Refusal to accept legal tender in payment of an existing debt, where no other means of payment/settlement has been specified in advance, conceivably could have consequences in legal proceedings,"" the Reserve Bank said.

Cash transactions were already declining

Concerns about coronavirus may be stymying cash transactions, but the use of notes and coins has been in decline for years.

Global firm Research and Markets predicted last year that Australia could become the Asia-Pacific's ""first cashless society"" by 2022.

The Commonwealth Bank offered a more cautious forecast, saying that was likelier to happen by 2026.

Yesterday, the Reserve Bank published its latest survey of how consumers pay for goods and services.

They found only one in four transactions last year were in cash; 13 years ago it was the opposite, with a quarter of our purchases made with cards.

However, the Reserve noted there were two main exceptions to this rapid switch in habits: poorer Australians and older Australians.

While people aged 65 and over used cash less often than they once did, they still used notes and coins for more than half of their payments.

'Hoarders' still want banknotes

Yet while fewer Australians than ever are using cash, some of us still want it — and large amounts of it — for a range of reasons.

The value of Australian currency in circulation has actually been trending upwards in recent years, almost all of it $50 and $100 bills.

In a paper published last year, two Reserve Bank staff analysed where the banknotes were and what they were used for.

They estimated that about half to three-quarters of the cash was essentially ""hoarded"" — both in Australia and overseas — as either savings or for emergency use.

About 15-35 per cent was used for ""legitimate transactions"", while the rest was either lost or used in the black economy.

So while coronavirus may be making us loathe to actually touch cash, it will be many years, if ever, before Australia's banknotes are killed off.

Updated

The Facebook post from the owner of a cafe in Lismore, on the New South Wales North Coast, was blunt and to the point.

Key points: Andrea Bonotto, co-owner of the Dirty Wilson burger bar in Lismore, says he can only stay open for three hours a day

Nightclubs have cancelled band tours because of the current 100-person limit in venues

A small business that makes ribbons for agricultural shows is facing a bleak future

""This is not business as usual … our staff are confused and scared and so are we. We are shitting ourselves on how we can run a business on an 80 per cent downturn.""

Andrea Bonotto is co-owner of the Dirty Wilson burger bar in the Lismore CBD, where opening times have been cut back to just three hours a day.

""Town is very quiet at the moment and everybody's feeling it,"" he said.

""There's been a massive downturn and a couple of shops have already closed or are planning to close.""

One of those is just around the corner — the French Bench cafe shut down this week, with its owners announcing the news on social media.

""As we have all become more aware of the coronavirus crisis that we are all facing, our sales have slowed to the point that we can't keep the cafe open,"" the statement said.

""But in a way, this is great news because it shows us that the community of people we love have taken the news of this virus seriously and are all bunkering down and staying safe.""

No weddings, parties or anything

The effects of coronavirus restrictions, which include a ban on indoor gatherings of more than 100 people, are being felt across the state.

The Yoogali Club in Griffith is known for hosting extravagant weddings with hundreds, sometimes thousands, of people.

Board member Bruno Musitano said it was now closed indefinitely, leaving around 60 casual and permanent staff members facing an uncertain future.

""I'm sure there were a few tears shed when the wedding parties were notified, but I think they understand,"" he said.

""It's hard for us because that's our forte, we rely on functions like that.

""We can't afford to close our doors, we need our functions, we need our everyday trade just to keep the wheels turning, but we made a decision because we don't want to be responsible for hosting something and something bad comes out of it.""

Band tours, local agricultural shows cancelled

On the Mid North Coast, the operator of a nightclub attached to the Coffs Hotel told the ABC there was still some confusion about how new social-distancing rules would be applied.

Samuel Phillips said he was hoping the 100-person limit would apply to each venue, rather than the building as a whole.

""Hopefully it's not 100 people in the whole venue, like Winxx and the Coffs Hotel — if that does happen it will really hurt us,"" he said.

""I've already cancelled all my touring acts because we're not going to be able to financially support that because we can only get 100 people in.

""It's always gut-wrenching cancelling gigs because, for all the acts, that's where their money is unfortunately.""

A family business that has run for 45 years in the Wollondilly Shire, south-west of Sydney, is also facing a bleak short-term future.

Marellen Show Ribbons at Silverdale had about 140 orders from clients across the globe before the coronavirus pandemic reached Australia.

Owner Tina Thorpe said she now only had five clients who wanted to proceed with their orders.

""This should be my busiest time of the year, where I would work seven days a week,"" she said.

""I employ five local ladies and all of them are casuals. If I don't have any work how can I be expected to pay them?

""If this takes six months, like what the Government says, before we can hold any outdoor events, I cannot operate for six months.""

Bluesfest off

Even traditional tourism hotspots were doing it tough, with Byron Bay's Bluesfest cancelled earlier this week.

Last year the event generated an estimated $59 million for the Northern Rivers economy, with $35.5 million being spent in the Byron Shire alone.

Mayor Simon Richardson said some businesses would struggle to recover.

""I think there are going to be some big players as well as smaller players who will find it really hard,"" he said.

""People have a pretty misguided understanding of how much profit there is in some of these events, so it sometimes doesn't take too long and too much to go wrong for somebody to hit the wall.

""Clearly, this is an economic disaster.""

Regional towns need support

Damian Kelly, from Business NSW, said the coronavirus crisis was hitting regional areas particularly hard.

""Many areas are still overcoming drought and bushfires,"" he said.

""Spend your money in the towns, support your local businesses because they will need your support over the coming months.

""And when we're all through this, they will be there to thrive and employ local people.""

Qantas and Jetstar are suspending all international flights from late March as well as cutting 60 per cent of domestic flights because of coronavirus.

The huge disruption to services also means two-thirds of Qantas and Jetstar's 30,000 employees will be temporarily stood down from late March until at least the end of May.

More than 150 aircraft have been temporarily grounded, including all of Qantas's A380s, 747s and 787-9s and Jetstar's 787-8s.

""The efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus have led to a huge drop in travel demand, the likes of which we have never seen before,"" Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said.

Updated

The ACT has recorded its fourth case of coronavirus, as the government announces a drive-through testing station to help with demand.

Key points: The fourth confirmed person with COVID-19 had recently travelled overseas

A new drive-through testing centre for the virus will be established at EPIC

Only those who meet the testing criteria will be assessed for coronavirus

A test came back positive for a woman aged in her 20s who has recently returned from overseas, ACT Health has confirmed.

ACT Chief Health Officer Dr Kerryn Coleman said the woman had followed self-quarantining directions for travellers returning from overseas and is now isolating with ACT Health support.

A small number of the woman's close contacts have been identified and contacted this afternoon.

ACT Health is also working to identify those who were in close proximity to the infected woman while travelling back to Canberra, who could potentially have been exposed.

They are:

People who sat in rows 71-75 on flight QF94 from Los Angeles to Melbourne, which arrived at 8:30am on March 17.

People in rows 15-19 of QF2130 from Melbourne to Canberra, departing at noon and arriving at 1:30pm on March 17.

Canberrans who sat in these rows are being asked to quarantine themselves and to call the Communicable Disease Control Section of ACT Health on (02) 5124 9213.

Anyone else travelling on these flights in other rows are not considered to be a close contact, and as a precaution, should monitor their health until 31 March. They are not being asked to self-quarantine.

""ACT Health will be working with national authorities to identify individuals who are close contacts as a priority,"" a statement from the health department read.

""We are alerting any Canberrans while this work is underway.""

ACT Health Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith said that the fact this woman had contracted the virus overseas aligns with the understanding that community transmission is not currently occurring in the ACT.

The two earlier cases in Canberra were both men in their 30s. Yesterday's third confirmed case was a woman in her 70s.

New testing centre to assess people in their cars

ACT Health also announced at Thursday's press conference that they are establishing a drive-through testing centre for the virus.

The drive-through centre will be located at EPIC Park in Canberra's north, and will start to assess people who meet the criteria for testing from 9:30am on Friday, March 20.

Ms Stephen-Smith said the new centre would speed up the testing process, and is designed to complement the current testing centre at the walk-in clinic in Weston Creek.

""Here we are introducing what is effectively a drive-through respiratory assessment centre,"" Ms Stephen-Smith said.

""You'll drive up, you'll be assessed by a nurse … and self-isolate until you get your result back.""

Ms Stephen-Smith said people would be required to remain in their cars as they were tested, which would assist in protecting health workers from being exposed to COVID-19.

Those who drive-up will be asked if they meet the criteria, and then proceed through to a dedicated testing area.

Ms Stephen-Smith said the process, which should not take more then 20 minutes, had proven to be efficient in other jurisdictions.

""It's very convenient for people, but it also provides that element of additional protection for our healthcare workers,"" she said.

She made clear that the criteria for testing had not changed: it remains defined as being only those with symptoms of coronavirus — including fever, dry cough, headache and sore throat — who have also travelled within the last 14 days or who have come into contact with an infected person.

Those who arrive who do not meet the criteria will be turned away.

Restrictions placed on hospital visitors

New restrictions are also being placed on visitors at Canberra's major public hospitals, in an effort to protect vulnerable patients from coronavirus.

From today, patients will be allowed only one visitor at a time, and anyone with flu-like symptoms will be refused access.

Anyone with appointments in outpatient clinics have also been asked not to bring people in with them unless absolutely necessary.

The restrictions apply at the Canberra Hospital, Calvary, and the University of Canberra Hospital.

However, Dr Sanjaya Senanayake from Canberra Health Services says exceptions can be made where appropriate.

""If someone is extremely unwell, and on their last legs, of course we will try and accommodate family,"" he said.

""Or if there's a child who needs to visit a sick parent, of course we're going to accommodate people.

""But we're just trying to get that sense of social distancing not just within the community, but within the hospital.""

Almost 1,900 people have been tested in the ACT for coronavirus so far, but only a small number have tested positive.

Ms Stephen-Smith said that was proof that community transmission is not occurring.

Health workers who come into contact with infected people are also being tested, Ms Stephen Smith said.

Coles ram raid unrelated to coronavirus panic buying

Meanwhile, a ram raid at a supermarket in Curtin on Wednesday night was not connected to coronavirus panic buying, ACT Policing said.

The front entrance of the Coles supermarket in Canberra's south was smashed in, with the car's paint staining the door. Police said the offenders were after cigarettes, but left empty handed.

The entrance was blocked off Thursday morning by a single shopping trolley. But despite the damage, the store still opened at 7am for elderly customers, with other shoppers queuing outside.

Updated

The best thing politicians can do in times of national crisis can often be not to promise to fix the problem, but take voters into their confidence about what they are trying to do to address them.

Our leaders might not have all the answers and things might not all be as they should, but telling people why they are taking the decisions they are taking and giving them a sense that they are on the case can help calm people down.

Psychologists have linked the bizarre obsession with toilet paper hoarding and the extraordinarily unattractive behaviour of Australians in supermarkets in recent weeks to a sense of lack of control.

The Prime Minister who emerged into the courtyard at Parliament House on Wednesday, along with the chief medical officer Brendan Murphy, seemed a very different figure to the one who delivered the folksy ""address to the nation"", which was notably short of any great detail, just six days earlier.

And you may have noticed too, that the general tone of politics has changed under the weight of this emergency: the cheap political points and slogans have largely gone, even if the Government can't quite take that extra step of bringing the Opposition into the national cabinet.

An extensive explanation on keeping schools open

It wasn't the new round of measures that Scott Morrison was announcing aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus that was important on Wednesday, or even his message that people should ""just stop it"" on hoarding. It was that he gave himself, and Professor Murphy, enough time to explain the thinking behind them.

And the message that this was a crisis that was likely to be with us for at least six months was also much better put: and with it, the need to understand that any measures taken now would have to be sustainable for at least that long, not be considered as something that could just be implemented for two or four weeks. That included the question of schools.

The explanation on why schools should stay open — and students attend them — was more extensive. The Prime Minister pointed to the fact that Singapore (one of the countries that has most successfully contained the virus) kept its schools open as support for the position.

Now, that doesn't mean a lot of people won't agree with it. It won't stop parents making their own decisions about whether their kids should go to school or individual schools closing.

Federal and state governments are continuing to work on the problematic aspects of schools: issues like whether governments can organise schooling for health workers, for example. And you can be certain this policy in the broad will evolve and change.

Cabinet 'following same rules as every Australian'

At some point in the extraordinary times in which we find ourselves, the reality is that people will take their own decisions, just as people have stopped going to restaurants, stopped travelling and, yes, continued to panic purchase.

We will all have to make our own decisions. We can only look to governments to provide the best medical advice they have to hand.

But we expect them to explain that advice and their decisions in those circumstances.

Important in the process of building a bit of trust was the Prime Minister's explanation of why he had not been tested for the virus in the wake of Peter Dutton's positive result, given he had been sitting in a Cabinet meeting with the Home Affairs Minister three days earlier (along with the rest of the Cabinet).

Until now, he has tended to just dismiss questions about this, even though the apparent contradiction in the way ministers were behaving, compared with the advice to others, was a really bad and confusing signal to the rest of the community.

On Wednesday, he said the Cabinet was ""following the same rules as every other Australian"".

While he had had a regular medical check-up on Tuesday night, ""what I'm saying is that there can't be one rule for me and another rule for the rest of the country"".

""Testing equipment is an important resource, and I'll follow the rules like everybody else. I've already put in place arrangements with the Cabinet. We're meeting now virtually. We're not gathering the Cabinet all together in one room. The contact tracing on that event has already been undertaken, and so, where that has led to the need for tests to be undertaken, where people are exhibiting symptoms and had contact, then people will undertake the tests,"" the Prime Minister said.

""There will be a number of Cabinet members who had tests. Not in relation to that specifically, but where they have satisfied the case definition, which has been set out by the chief medical officer, and I can assure you in all of these cases where there has been a question arise as to whether that should be done, we'll consult with either the chief medical officer or the deputy chief medical officer. I'd encourage all Australians to do that.""

That same consistency seemed to be present in the jointly negotiated decision of Government and Opposition to get MPs and senators who represent remote communities, who are older, or a handful who have already tested positive for the virus, to stay away from Canberra when it sits next week to pass the spending measures being put forward by the Government.

Australia likely to close its doors

The Prime Minister talked at the Wednesday press conference of how there had been a gear change last weekend in the response to the virus as it became clear there was now transmission in the community, albeit at a low level, and as the federal and state governments joined in a national cabinet.

You need that sort of coordination when you are starting to create exclusion zones in areas of Australia, like remote communities (even if you argue at the same time it is not possible to lock down large areas of the country), and when you are placing heavy restrictions on visits to aged care communities.

There is going to be more to come from our governments, on a rolling basis.

All the signs are now in place that, along with the rest of the world, Australia is likely to completely close its doors in the period ahead.

The Federal Government is looking at further measures to support the economy.

Its airline package on Wednesday, for example, is some relief for the airlines but doesn't necessarily help airline staff or ancillary industries.

But the Prime Minister made clear the need for income support — for an even bigger economic ""safety net"" for Australians — was front and centre of their deliberations on the new measures.

Shortly afterwards, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews both confirmed this and stepped up the message a notch, acknowledging and saying federal and state governments were working on the basis that ""we need to be providing that sort of emergency capital, that sort of emergency cash"".

""We are doing some work, we will have more to say about that,"" Mr Andrews said.

""It is important to get this right. To be calm, to be considered and no doubt, the Federal Government is considering issues of guaranteeing mortgages, guaranteeing income, all manner of different measures.""

The calls, particularly from the medical community, for more equipment and faster action will continue, completely understandably. But just as the quality of information being made available to the public through health websites has lifted this week, the quality of the messaging from our political leaders seems to have also made a much-needed improvement.

Updated

If you are facing home quarantine because of the coronavirus pandemic, it's worth considering that time spent making a handmade item can bring great joy.

Key points: Dressmaking newcomers find sewing ""a relaxing, beautiful activity""

Designer and sewing instructor Loo Taylor runs workshops in Berry and Kangaroo Valley after attending the London College of Fashion

Classes honour the idea that handmade garments from quality fabrics are classic pieces and not fast fashion

When Kangaroo Valley's Intan Kallus started sewing last year, she watched YouTube videos to learn the basics and managed to whip up a few pieces.

""I made shopping bags, skirts for my daughter, and then I started classes with Loo,"" she said.

She means Kangaroo Valley's design doyenne and couturier Loo Taylor, who runs monthly clothes-making clinics.

Inspired to help out the Kangaroo Valley agricultural show this month, Ms Intan entered three machine-made garments, taking out first and second prizes.

""I'm really proud and really happy. I'm actually really surprised,"" she said.

Tricks of the trade

Ms Intan, who attends The Clothes Clinic sewing classes in Berry and the Valley, works closely with Ms Taylor to pick up more tricks of the trade.

""I had no idea that sewing was such a beautiful activity. It's very relaxing. I absolutely love it,"" she said.

For Ms Intan, sewing is the best way to relax and chill out.

""It's very therapeutic,"" Ms Kallus said.

Passion for slow fashion

Ms Taylor has always had a passion for textiles. She's a highly skilled pattern maker, which is rare these days.

""Luckily I was of that generation where I grew up with a mother who sewed. She taught me those skills,"" Ms Taylor said.

Training at the London College of Fashion and working in high-end couture, fashion has always been a passion.

""I love the creative process. I get excited by the fabrics. I get excited by the ideas of what I can do with those fabrics, shapes, and new ways of doing things. It keeps me awake at night sometimes,"" she said.

Sharing that passion is her motivation for leading public workshops and she encourages everybody to learn to sew.

""It's knowledge that will go to the grave with me otherwise. I've realised there is a whole generation of women who haven't grown up learning to make clothes,"" Ms Taylor said.

""Some women can't even sew at all.

""I think these days we are quite devoid of creative processes in our life.""

Ms Taylor believes cheap, throw-away fashion is one reason women no longer sew.

""I'm really happy that my wanting to teach these skills has coincided with a reawakening of the idea of quality garments made from quality fabrics that are classic and not 'fast fashion',"" she said.

""It's OK to put hours of work into something if you make it out of good fabric and it fits you, and it suits you and you love it … you'll wear it for years.""

A lot of her sewing students comment on how calming they find the activity.

""They love immersing themselves in making clothes and not having to worry about anything else at the time,"" Ms Taylor said.

New experiences, new techniques

In a pink weatherboard shop off the main street of Berry, Berry Quilt and Co has been a destination for fabric, patterns, pins and sewing workshops for 20 years.

""It's a place where people come and meet and learn skills. Explore their hobby,"" owner Sharon Thomson said.

Ms Thomson is seeing a resurgence of people taking pride in making their own garments.

""People are really considering what they are choosing to make. People are able to come to classes with a pattern they would like to make. Here they can tweak them and make a quality garment that fits,"" she said.

""A lot of people make things as gifts — patchwork quilts, bags, cushions — and they take pride in knowing that they've made that especially for that person and that person is excited to receive it.""

Updated

Livestock industries have been told to exercise caution, despite no concrete evidence so far of human-to-animal transmission of the coronavirus strain COVID-19.

Key points: The possibility of COVID-19 spreading from humans to key livestock industries appears small

More research is needed to understand how different animals could be affected by the virus

A farmer is closing his farm to visitors until he gets direct information from biosecurity officials



The virus, which is believed to have originated in a Chinese fresh meat market, has rapidly spread despite measures to close borders and isolate patients.

Professor of Infectious Diseases Modelling and Epidemiology at James Cook University (JCU), Emma McBryde, said the possibility of a spread through key livestock industries appeared small.

""The source of the virus is still a little unclear … the virus is most similar to those found in bats,"" she said.

""There was probably another intermediate host between bats and humans that was the original source of the virus, various animals have been implicated.""

A possibility, but need close contact

Professor McBryde said the only instance of the strain being found in animals since it began circulating among humans was a dog that tested positive in Hong Kong.

""That dog didn't become unwell and it may be that that dog had COVID-19 on them, as a consequence of being near someone who was shedding a lot of COVID-19,"" she said.

Adjunct Professor Graham Burgess from the College of Public Health, Medical and Veterinary Sciences at JCU said any mammal was a potential carrier of coronavirus.

""What that would suggest is any mammalian host is a possibility, if we try hard enough we can probably infect almost any mammalian host,"" he said.

""In order to transmit it, those animals are going to have to be exposed to an infectious host and that's not easy, you have to have pretty close contact.""

'Taking no risks'

A farmer who has struggled to get direct information from biosecurity officials is taking the step of closing his farm to visitors.

Dan Cordner raises free-range Sommerlad chickens on his property at Ingham in north Queensland and said with 25 per cent of the nation's breeding stock of the rare breed, he was enacting strict procedures.

""We've basically shut down the farm to all visitors. We're not allowing anybody to come and visit the farm,"" he said.

""We just can't take a risk on-farm, which is why we've taken what would be seen by many as extreme measures.

""We've got birds that you can't just go out and buy replacements for.""

Mr Cordner said he took the measure based on conversations with veterinarians, despite fruitless attempts to get in touch with Queensland's agriculture officials.

""We've been waiting for a return phone call for about two weeks now,"" he said.

""Each time they've taken a message to pass onto their poultry specialist, but unfortunately we haven't had any luck in that space.""

A spokesman for Biosecurity Queensland said further studies were needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus.

Widespread in mammals

Professor Burgess said all common domesticated animals had adapted coronaviruses over the past 2,000 years, including bovines and dogs.

He added coronaviruses in dogs and cats were found to be made up of combined genetic material from other coronaviruses.

""It's not totally out of the question that we could get an animal infected with say, both a bovine and a human coronavirus and have a brand new coronavirus being produced,"" he said.

Pork producers in North America have recently suffered losses from a form of the infection originating in Asia.

""Pigs in the US, fairly recently were infected with a beta coronavirus that was imported probably from China. It caused major problems of diarrhoea and high death rates,"" Professor Burgess said.

Keeping strict personal hygiene with regular washing of hands and keeping distance from animals is suggested for those working with livestock.

""I would imagine the majority of farmers would not have sufficient intimate contact with animals,"" he said.

""Keeping in mind this is an envelope virus, which means any detergent, any soap will do the job to remove it from your hands.""

No reports of animal infection

A spokesperson from the Federal Department of Agriculture said COVID-19 had not been reported in any domestic animals or wildlife in Australia.

The statement said there was no evidence the virus could be transmitted from a domestic animal to a person, or between domestic animals but biosecurity plans should be implemented.

As researchers across the globe attempt to find an immunisation solution to stem the spread of COVID-19, Professor Burgess said experimental inoculations could be tried.

""We can grow this virus quite readily in cell culture which means we've got an ability to have a well-regulated dose,"" he said.

""I would imagine that in Australia the only place we would ever contemplate doing that would be [CSIRO's] Australian Animal Health Laboratory. It's a fairly expensive exercise.""

Updated

The ACT Government has confirmed a third case of coronavirus, as panicked Canberrans drive up to an hour-and-a-half away to buy groceries.

Key points: The third confirmed case in Canberra is a woman in her 70s who tested positive last night

As of 8:00am today, 1,389 people in the ACT have returned negative tests for the disease

The two earlier confirmed COVID-19 cases both involved men in their 30s

The woman who tested positive to COVID-19 is aged in her 70s, and was admitted to Canberra Hospital last night.

It is believed she was infectious while on a Garuda Indonesia flight GA712 from Jakarta to Sydney, which landed on Saturday morning, March 14.

The woman then boarded a Murrays bus from Sydney airport to Canberra at 12.25pm that day.

ACT Chief Health Officer Kerryn Coleman said she was working with the airline and coach service to find other people who might have been exposed.

The woman wore a mask while on the bus, and Dr Coleman said that action ""greatly reduced the risk"" of spreading the virus.

""We still believe there is a small increased risk of exposure to people travelling on that bus,"" she said.

""Anything over two hours in a closely confined room is what we consider an increased risk.""

Dr Coleman said health officials would try to alert people who might have been in close contact with the woman.

She added Canberra remained in an ""excellent position"" generally to contain the disease, especially given the challenges facing other cities.

""We certainly don't have community transition in the ACT at the moment,"" she said.

""There's no area that should be avoided.""

The ACT was the last state or territory to confirm a case of the disease. The two earlier cases both involved men in their 30s.

As of 8:00am today, 1,389 people in Canberra had returned negative tests for COVID-19.

Canberrans targeting regional grocers

The third confirmed case of COVID-19 coincides with continued panic buying in ACT supermarkets.

Empty shelves and out-of-stock items have reportedly led some Canberrans to drive up to an hour-and-a-half away to stockpile food and groceries.

Some stores in regional towns report they are now cracking down on the visitors by imposing limits on what they buy.

Floyd Davies, who co-owns a small supermarket in Crookwell, about 130 kilometres north of Canberra, said he was seriously concerned that he could not supply his community.

""There are people from Canberra coming over and a significant amount from Goulburn, which is 30 minutes away, to do their shopping,"" he said.

""We know lots of the other owners and everyone is in the same boat — I don't think there is a supermarket that we know of that hasn't been stretched to the limits in terms of staff, in terms of stock.

""We're just not quite sure how long supply will last.""

Crookwell locals stopping by for supplies were disappointed to find bare shelves.

""It's ridiculous. It's really ridiculous. I'm sort of ashamed of my fellow Australians at the moment, it's not good,"" one local said.

Another said it was hard to know how to manage the situation.

""Being a local, we kind of know most of our local people, but when strangers come in you can't sort of say, 'oh, you're from out of town, you can't shop here.'""

However, Woolworths chief executive Brad Banducci said Australia does not have a food shortage.

""We have enough product in Australia to feed all of our customers,"" he told ABC Radio Melbourne's Mornings host Virginia Trioli.

""What we're experiencing at the moment is [not] the equivalent of feeding 24 million Australians, but trying to feed 50 million Australians and that's where the issue lies.""

Woolworths joined other major supermarket chains today in urging shoppers to treat their staff with respect, in light of the recent fights over products breaking out in stores.

Aldi, Coles, Woolworths and IGA paid for full-page advertisements in many newspapers to tell readers they were doing ""everything possible"" to maintain stock levels.

""So we ask you to please be considerate in the way you shop …"" the advertisement read.

""No one working or shopping in any of our stores should experience abuse or aggressive behaviour.""

The supermarket giants also urged shoppers to buy only what they needed, saying ""it helps everyone, especially the elderly and people with disability"".

Prime Minister Scott Morrison also pleaded with Australians to stop buying more than they needed at supermarkets in a press conference this morning.

""Stop hoarding. I can't be more blunt about it,"" he said.

""It is not sensible, it is not helpful, and it has been one of the most disappointing things I have seen in Australian behaviour in response to this crisis.""

Updated

Natalie McBurney and her 12-year-old daughter, Celeste, have been self-isolating in their Canberra home.

It's not because they are suspected of having Coronavirus, but because the virus has the potential to strike Ms McBurney down.

The single mother lives with Crohns disease, a chronic inflammation of the digestive tract, and that makes her one of the vulnerable people health authorities are trying to protect.

In order to protect herself from coronavirus, which could be deadly to her already diminished immune system, she has cancelled her beautician client appointments to self-isolate and taken her daughter out of school.

And like many others, Ms McBurney is now facing an uncertain financial future, with rent and bills to pay.

Healthy people asked to enact social distancing

Crohn's disease is an auto-immune condition that leaves sufferers immunocompromised.

""It causes my body to attack itself as a standard, as a baseline. I get malnourished,"" said Ms McBurney.

It is painful and potentially life-threatening, and she takes strong medication to dull its assault on her body.

But the drugs have crippled her immune system, leaving her dangerously exposed if she contracts COVID-19.

While many come down with only mild symptoms when infected with COVID-19, the concern is that people like Ms McBurney will not be so lucky.

""With coronavirus, death is in the realm of possibilities, which is really quite frightening,"" she said.

She has also pulled her daughter Celeste out of school.

Celeste is now learning alongside her mother via an online portal and with remote support from her teachers.

Ms McBurney said she wanted to ensure her daughter did not bring the virus home with her.

""I know the children are less likely to be taken down by it — which is why I think they've kept schools open — however, if she brings something home to me with no symptoms, it will be in my home,"" she said.

""I can't fight it then.""

Like others who are immunocompromised, Ms McBurney said she was concerned many people were not taking the appropriate steps to self-isolate if they had symptoms similar to those of COVID-19.

She said the risk was too high that she would be exposed to an infected person, which is why she has chosen to self-isolate with her daughter until she felt safe enough to return to normal.

She implored the community to consider the ""flow-on effects"" of contracting the virus and transmitting it.

Normal life put on hold

Ms McBurney also made the decision to close her home salon, located in the Canberra suburb of O'Connor, indefinitely, to protect herself.

""I do facials, skin care treatments, waxing, eyebrows, sugaring, tinting,"" she said.

""My work means that I can't get any distancing at all.""

She said having to cancel all her appointments and forgo an income was ""just as stressful as leaving the house these days.""

Crunching the numbers, she estimated she would have enough money to buy the essentials for nine weeks.

But with a surprise tax bill arriving this week, even that was now up in the air.

""I've looked at how many weeks I can survive ... I'm not sure entirely what's going to happen,"" she said.

""I was actually looking at my bank balance and thinking, how the hell is this going to go? And I saw a deposit in there.

""I checked my email and I had a client who transferred me some money.""

She said the generous donation was overwhelming, but that she had not felt anywhere near that level of support from authorities.

She said she tried to apply for a sickness benefit through her general practitioner but was told she was not sick enough.

She also enquired with ACT Housing about accessing rental relief on her government-owned property, and was told to fill in a form.

'The burden shouldn't fall upon them'

Like Natalie, Canberra student Mary Clare Woodford is facing an uncertain financial future due to the pandemic.

After the call centre she worked at closed to stop transmissions, she lost the 13 hours of work she relies on.

""I think it's the right decision, but it's stressful because of what it means for me in terms of making money,"" Ms Woodford said.

""I'm going to get last week's pay coming in this week, but next week or even the week after I'm not really sure what will happen.

""[My work] has been sending us as much information as possible which is reassuring, but it's still unclear what my work will be like in the coming weeks or it I'll have the same amount of hours,"" she said.

Studying at the Australian National University, Ms Woodford is not eligible for youth allowance, and is not unsure how she is going to pay her rent.

""This is actually the first home I've lived in where I'm on the lease. I don't want anything to happen to my rental history,"" she said.

""A couple of years down the line when I'm looking for a house, I don't want to have an eviction or the fact that I wasn't paying my rent to affect my future.

""If we can't pay rent, we shouldn't have to leave this house.""

Like Ms McBurney, Ms Woodford said she hoped the ACT Government would take steps to assist people with lost income due to the pandemic.

""It's really shone a light on how precarious a lot of people's lives are,"" she said.

""There should be government support for people in this situation — I can imagine so many people in this situation — but it's really hard to know who to turn to.

""There's support for me in the community and my housemates have said they'll help me, but it shouldn't fall upon my housemates — that burden shouldn't fall upon them.""

Calls for measures to protect ACT renters

Unions ACT have called on the Government to enact reforms to residential and commercial tenancy laws to help those unable to make rent.

Among their recommendations were that casual workers who were stood down, sacked or had reduced shifts should not be evicted for failing to make rent during the coronavirus crisis.

The union also said that rental increases should be banned.

They also drew attention to the plight of small businesses facing the cost of a commercial lease while their income dropped off.

Unions ACT secretary Alex White urged the Government to temporarily void clauses of leases that would make a business unviable.

""Working people should not pay the costs of the federal government's calls to voluntarily self-isolate, or face personal economic ruin or homelessness if they are stood down without pay,"" he said.

""Sensible reforms to rental laws — residential and commercial — will reduce the impact of the crisis on workers and support public health measures.""

The NSW Government yesterday announced plans to waive payroll tax for small businesses with a payroll of up to $10 million, until the end of the financial year.

They are also eliminating some fees and charges which apply to businesses in vulnerable sectors, such as cafes and tradespeople.

Similarly, the WA Government announced a one-off grant of $17,500 for small to medium businesses with a payroll of between $1 million and $4 million.

On Wednesday in a press conference Chief Minister Andrew Barr said they are consulting with industry groups and the Opposition.

""The ACT Government will undertake a round of economic stimulus measures this week there will be further measures in our budget in the middle of the year,"" he said.

In a statement, the ACT Government pointed to existing and planned legislation aimed at protecting renters.

New laws took affect last year, preventing landlords from increasing rents more than ten percent above the consumer price index without agreement from the tenant.

Further legislation is currently before the ACT Legislative Assembly, aimed at protecting renters against “unreasonable evictions”.

Updated

Last week's opening of the National Photographic Portrait Prize was cancelled amid fears of spreading coronavirus, but you can see some of the amazing pictures here — including winner Rob Palmer's portrait.

Key points: Sydney photographer Rob Palmer won this year's national photographic portrait prize

His image portrays chef Josh Niland's passion for 'zero waste' cooking — using the whole fish

The National Portrait Gallery says it will stay open during the coronavirus epidemic and is displaying the 48 finalists' works

The Sydney photographer's efforts to capture a chef's passion for his work won him the $50,000 prize, which National Portrait Gallery director Karen Quinlan announced online instead of in front of the expected crowd of finalists and guests.

Palmer shot the portrait of chef Josh Niland with a dolphinfish last year, and it was one of about 2,500 submissions to the lucrative annual competition.

He said he had struck luck with the image's composition — he was trying to capture Niland in his element and it proved relatively simple.

""You enter these amazing competitions — and I don't enter them very often — and you don't ever expect to win them,"" Palmer said.

""There are times you've got to fight to get an image, you need to craft it, you need to think about what's going to go on and work very hard at it.

""But there are images like this which just sort of present themselves.""

He said his aim was to convey the chef's passion for working with the whole fish, from fin to tail.

""Zero waste is his big thing — using every part of the fish — and that is what really inspired the image,"" he said.

Palmer had been working with Niland on a cookbook for more than a week before the right moment presented itself.

""Josh pulled out this massive mahi-mahi [dolphinfish]… He just has so much respect for the food and the fish he works with,"" Palmer said.

""It's just this almost intimate moment between him and his fish.""

The judges praised Palmer's finesse; one of them, Nici Cumpston, said the work embodied ""the feeling that the chef has for the fish"".

Meanwhile, Hugh Stewart's portrait of dancer Eileen Kramer was highly commended among the 47 other finalists on display at the gallery.

Kramer moved back to Australia from New York when she was 98, because she wanted to hear a kookaburra laugh. She turns 105 this year.

And, although the exhibition's official launch was cancelled, the National Portrait Gallery is one of several galleries and museums in Canberra that have chosen to remain open to the public — although public programs and events like the launch have been cancelled.

The photographic portraits will be on display until May, before travelling to other venues around the country.

Here's a snapshot of what can be viewed at the gallery:

Updated

A public health emergency for the ACT has come into effect, after Canberra's second case of COVID-19 was confirmed.

Key points: The ACT joins Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia in declaring a public health emergency

During an emergency, ACT authorities can issue fines of up to $8,000 to people who breach orders to isolate

Canberra recorded its second confirmed case of coronavirus on Sunday

A man in his 30s tested positive to coronavirus on Sunday evening and had followed health officials' advice by isolating himself at home, ACT Health said in a statement.

ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr announced on Monday the territory would join Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia in declaring a public health emergency, after the ACT became the final jurisdiction in Australia to record a confirmed COVID-19 case..

It is expected that all states and territories will do the same as part of a national response to tackling the epidemic.

Mr Barr said there was no short-term solution and decisions taken now would have long-lasting effects.

""It's not just everyone goes into quarantine for two weeks and it goes away,"" he said.

""This virus will continue to circle the globe until everyone is immune to it or a vaccine is developed.""

While an emergency declaration is in place, the ACT chief health officer has powers to remove threats to public health, including by isolating or quarantining people.

The Public Health Act includes fines of up to $8,000 for people who breach orders to isolate.

""A declaration of a public health emergency enables the chief health officer to take the necessary actions required to keep Canberrans safe,"" Mr Barr said.

Also announced on Monday was the cancellation of the Canberra Comedy Festival.

Easter's National Folk Festival, which attracts 15,000 people to Canberra, has also been cancelled, as has music festival Groovin The Moo.

Infected man visited arts festival, pub days earlier

ACT Health said the second person to be infected was assisting them as they worked to locate anyone he may have been in contact with.

On Monday afternoon, Telopea Park School said it had been told a person infected with the virus had visited the school grounds briefly while infectious but did not enter any buildings.

In a letter to parents, the school said there was ""negligible risk of exposure"" posed to staff, children and others in the school community.

It was also revealed the infected man was at two public locations over the weekend: the Art Not Apart festival, held in New Acton, between 4:00pm and 5:00pm on Saturday, and Capital Brewing Co in Fyshwick from 5:00pm until 6:30pm.

Chief health officer's emergency powers: order people to isolate themselves

order people to evacuate an area

close any road or path and prevent access to any place

enter any place if needed to protect people's health Source: ACT Public Health Act, sections 120 and 121 Source: ACT Public Health Act, sections 120 and 121

Chief Health Officer Kerryn Coleman said the risk of transmission to anyone who was at those venues at those times was low.

However those who were at those locations that evening were being asked to be aware of the symptoms of COVID-19, which include fever, cough, sore throat and shortness of breath.

In a statement on its Facebook page, Capital Brewing Co said it had thoroughly sanitised all customer touchpoints in the venue as a precaution and advised staff to monitor their health.

Schools open but camps, excursions, events cancelled

ACT schools remain open, with restrictions on large student gatherings.

However, all student sports events, concerts, assemblies, excursions and camps have been cancelled.

""All of the measures that have been put in place nationwide will apply in the ACT, there will be national consistency on every single measure,"" Mr Barr said.

He said any decision to close schools would not be taken lightly.

""Decisions we take now would be very difficult to undo,"" he said.

""If we close schools, that's it for the year.

""People need to understand the gravity of all this and how decisions need to be taken calmly and sensibly against a risk reduction matrix guided by advice of health professionals.""

Other Canberra venues and events will remain open to the public, though some are restricting visitor numbers.

The National Gallery announced it would continue to operate, though it had cancelled all events, tours and school groups for four weeks.

Meanwhile, Capital Football said grassroots soccer matches would be go on as planned but with extra precautions to reduce the risk of infection.

""This includes recommended hygiene measures and appropriate social distancing at football matches,"" the governing body said in a statement.

Next month's Groovin The Moo festival, one of the most popular music events in Canberra, will not go ahead.

Its organisers, Cattleyard Promotions, said in a statement that the Federal Government's recommendations on social distancing made the event impossible.

""Unfortunately, GTM is unable to reschedule the 2020 events due to the uncertainty surrounding how long the ban will be in place for, along with the logistics involved with coordinating six venues across six states and territories to align with each other, and the schedules of both our national and international artists.""

The National Museum of Australia said it was cancelling public program activities including tours and school visits.

And the National Film and Sound Archive announced it would temporarily cancel education programs, on-site screenings, exhibitions and special events from 4:00pm Wednesday.

This week's Canberra Comedy Festival has been cancelled, as well as the National Folk Festival, which is held over the Easter Weekend and usually attracts about 15,000 people.

Folk Festival chairwoman Jacqueline Bradley says it is ""a deeply distressing time for everyone"", especially the performers, who face significant losses.

""We hope our audiences will do everything they can to support artists across any available platform at this difficult time,"" she said.

Meanwhile, Dendy Cinemas said it would only allow 50 per cent of each auditorium to be filled for viewings, and would implement staggered seating to ensure social distancing.

""We will not prevent families and friends from sitting next to each other,"" they said.

ANU recalls overseas students and staff

On Monday, the Australian National University said it had made the decision to recall all staff and students currently overseas on university travel, including those on exchange.

""Staff who are currently overseas on university travel will be contacted and be provided support to return home,"" the university said.

""The university has also suspended all future international travel until further notice.""

A statement published by the university said they were beginning to move some courses to an online format to reduce contact between members of the university community.

""This week we will begin moving towards online delivery for many of our large classes and look at those smaller classes and tutorials where social distancing is hard,"" it said.

The statement also urged university staff and students to take care of their physical and mental wellbeing as the crisis continued.

""We're all feeling the physical and mental health effects of this year,"" it said.

""It's important we all care for one another and each other and draw together as a supportive community.

""Please don't be afraid to seek support.""

Economic impact 'grim and difficult'

Mr Barr said the ACT was not immune to the economic impacts of COVID-19.

""Government alone will not be able to absorb all of the economic impact, it's going to have an impact on our local economy, the national economy and the global economy,"" he said.

""The situation is going to be grim and difficult for months and months and months.""

Mr Barr said the government was doing all it could to keep public transport operating and protect public servants.

Where practical, public servants were being given the option to work remotely and Mr Barr said steps were being taken to protect frontline workers.

""We can't just shut society down,"" he said.

""We have to go about — as much as we possibly can within a sensible risk reduction framework — life as normal.""

And for those Canberrans wanting to do all they can to help, Mr Barr urged them to be kind and look out for older residents.

""Be kind to one another, make good common-sense decision and reduce your risk,"" he said.

Updated

Melbourne's biggest universities are moving away from face-to-face learning in preparation for potential campus shutdowns, after Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus pandemic.

Key points: The announcements came after Victoria declared a state of emergency in a bid to curb the coronavirus pandemic

The declaration gives Victorian authorities additional powers to enforce a ban on large gatherings and self-isolation periods for those returning from overseas

The number of new COVID-19 cases in Victoria jumped by 14 overnight to 71

Swinburne, La Trobe, and Monash universities have announced that from Tuesday, all tutorials, workshops and practicals will be suspended until the end of the week so staff can prepare for online learning.

Lectures at La Trobe and Monash will be recorded and available online, while Swinburne University will pause lectures until next week.

Monash University said classes may continue online from next week or be delivered in an ""intensive mode"", and assessments and exams were being adapted to ""a non-face-to-face format"".

In an email to staff on Monday afternoon, the University of Melbourne announced it would cease all face-to-face lectures attended by more than 500 enrolled students from Tuesday.

All classes above 25 students will be ""progressively"" moved away from face-to-face delivery, while tutorials for small groups may continue in larger rooms to allow for social distancing, the email said.

In a statement, La Trobe University said the coronavirus outbreak was posing ""unprecedented challenges"" for the university community.

""Events over the weekend and this morning have necessitated a rapid review of the University's response — in particular the ban on large scale events announced on Friday, compulsory self-isolation for all visitors to Australia announced yesterday, and the Premier's announcement of a State of Emergency this morning,"" the statement said.

La Trobe University said if it was forced to close its campuses, all fixed-term and continuing staff would be paid, while casual staff would be paid for up to four weeks, based on the work they would have performed if the campus was not shut down.

State of emergency closes galleries, museums, libraries

The announcements were made in the wake of Premier Daniel Andrews's declaration of a state of emergency Monday morning, in a bid to curb the coronavirus pandemic.

Victorian galleries, museums, libraries and some schools chose to close their doors after the Government announcement.

Mr Andrews said it was likely the state of emergency, which was imposed under the Public Health and Wellbeing Act and took effect from midday Monday, would be extended.

He said the declaration would remain in place ""for as long as it needs to be"".

Andrew Barr, the Chief Minister of the ACT, declared a public health emergency within minutes of the Victorian declaration after the territory recorded its second case of COVID-19.

A state of emergency was declared in Western Australia Sunday, and its Government on Monday was introducing precautionary measures at schools across the state.

Emergency powers have also been invoked in New South Wales to force the immediate cancellation of public events of more than 500 people, with fines of up to $11,000 for those who break the laws.

Victoria's state of emergency gives the chief health officer the power to quarantine groups of people or place areas under social distancing measures.

The declaration gives Victoria the ability to enforce a ban on gatherings of more than 500 people and a mandatory 14-day self-isolation period for those returning to the country from overseas.

Non-essential gatherings of more than 500 people will be banned but that does not include travelling on public transport, or passing through public spaces on the way to work.

The main focus of the ban was sporting events, cultural events or functions a club or association might run which were not essential, Mr Andrews said.

Large conventions such as those that might run at the Melbourne Convention Centre or other similar venues are deemed non-essential.

Significant penalties were in place for those who failed to comply with the quarantine order, Mr Andrews said, but he said people were using ""common sense"" and fines were not anticipated.

""These powers have never been used before,"" Mr Andrews said.

""That gives you, I hope, a really clear sense about the unprecedented nature of this public health emergency, this really significant challenge.""

The state of emergency is different to the state of disaster which was declared during the summer's bushfire crisis.

Powers during a state of emergency: Powers to detain any person or group in a particular area to eliminate or reduce a serious risk to public health

The movement of people within the emergency area can be restricted

People can be prevented from entering an emergency area

Authorised officers can make any direction considered reasonably necessary to protect public health , section 200 Public Health and Wellbeing Act 2008 , section 200

Victorian health authorities on Monday said 14 new cases of coronavirus were confirmed in the state overnight.

The state's total on Monday stood at 71 cases.

Mr Andrews said ""nothing we do"" could deliver the outcome of no new cases, but the state's focus was on ""flattening the curve"" to prevent the health system from being overrun by critically ill patients.

""This is dynamic. It will change,"" he said.

Cruise liner enters Australia just in time

A Viking Orion cruise liner docked in Port Melbourne Monday afternoon as Australia's international lockdown measures came into effect.

A Border Force spokesman said about 724 people were on board the cruise ship, including 27 Australians.

The ship entered Australian waters just before Prime Minister Scott Morrison's ban on international cruise ships came into effect at midnight on Sunday.

""Everyone will be subject to the 14 day self-isolation period if they remain in Australia,"" the Border Force spokesman said.

About 40 people were expected to stay on the ship before catching a flight out of the country Tuesday.

The remaining passengers were either entering self-isolation in hotels or other accommodation, or trying to book flights out of Australia.

A Viking spokeswoman said the passengers had been provided with the latest information about mandatory self-isolation and the company was arranging flights for anyone who wanted to return home.

Viking also announced last week it would temporarily suspend all cruise operations until May.

For the first time since the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1919, ANZAC Day dawn services across Victoria have been cancelled, with only one private service to be held at the Shrine of Remembrance.

RSL Victoria has barred the public from attending and said only 20 official guests would be there to minimise the spread of COVID-19.

The annual ANZAC Day march through Melbourne's CBD and midday service at the Shrine of Remembrance have also been cancelled.

RSL sub-branches across regional Victoria will also be asked to conduct just one ANZAC Day commemorative service.

The booze buses regularly used by police to test drivers for drugs and alcohol on Victoria roads will no longer be used by police, Commissioner Graham Ashton announced at a press conference in the afternoon.

Instead, pairs of two officers will run drug and alcohol testing in mobile units, where it is easier to control sanitisation.

Libraries and galleries make 'gut-wrenching' decision to shut doors

Major institutions across Victoria have closed their doors to the public in a bid to limit the spread of the virus.

Melbourne Museum, Scienceworks, the Royal Exhibition Building, National Gallery of Victoria, Arts Centre Melbourne, Geelong Arts Centre and State Library Victoria are just some who have announced temporary closures.

Arts Centre Melbourne chief executive Claire Spencer said the decision was ""gut-wrenching"".

""'The show must go on' is our battle cry as an industry,"" she said.

""To say this decision is counterintuitive and deeply upsetting is a gross understatement.""

The producers of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child have also suspended performances until April 12.

After concerts were cancelled Sunday, the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra Monday afternoon announced it would live stream Monday night's performance of Scheherazade in order to ""keep the music going"".

In a statement, the orchestra said it planned to live stream more performances over coming weeks and urged ticketholders to consider donating their payment to fund the performances.

The gaming floor at Crown Casino will put in place some ""social distancing measures"" including shutting down every second electronic gaming machine and requiring customers to sit further apart, the casino said.

But events or functions involving more than 500 people would not be allowed to go ahead.

'Extraordinary times' as Melbourne's events grind to a halt

The City of Melbourne were to close its six libraries and four recreation centres from Monday until at least the end of the month, with the possibility of the closures being extended.

But the city's childcare centres will remain open.

Lord Mayor Sally Capp said March was one of the busiest months and 149 events had been cancelled due to the ban on large gatherings.

""We really are living in extraordinary times,"" she said.

The city's team of 400 red jacket volunteers who provide advice and assistance to tourists were to cease operations immediately.

Councillor Capp said she was worried that the city may turn into a ghost town as bars, restaurants and businesses closed down.

""If you feel well, sanitize and carry on,"" she said.

""We're encouraging people where they feel healthy and where it is appropriate to keep working and keep coming into the city.""

Woolworths has announced it will limit the first hour of trade in its supermarkets to the elderly and those with a disability.

The new rules will allow only those with a relevant government concession card to access the stores between 7:00am and 8:00am, beginning Tuesday, and will be in place until at least Friday.

The supermarket giant said the move was prompted by unprecedented demand over the past week.

Schools, aged care the priority for health meeting

State and federal health officials were to meet in Canberra Monday and into Tuesday to discuss the specifics of the coronavirus response, including the approach to aged care and education.

A number of schools in Melbourne have announced closures or extensions of existing closures due to coronavirus cases.

Carey Baptist Grammar School and Yeshivah-Beth Rivkah Colleges have announced extensions to existing closures, while St Kevin's College will be closed on Tuesday after the parent of two students tested positive for COVID-19.

The school is waiting for more information before making a decision on whether to remain open for the rest of the week.

A Government spokesperson said the Education Department's list of emergency school closures and relocations would continue to be updated with the latest information when possible.

A number of private schools across Victoria, including St Leonard's College in Brighton East, Ivanhoe Grammar School, and Ballarat Grammar, have announced they will close this week despite not having any confirmed coronavirus cases.

Most Victorian schools remain open for now and Victoria's chief health officer Brett Sutton said there was ""genuine uncertainty"" about whether they should be closed.

Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt took to social media this morning to warn the Victorian community about a fake letter that is designed to look like it was authored by him and his state counterpart, which falsely claimed schools were closed.

""Schools remain open with the unanimous support of the States and Commonwealth. The matter is being reported to the police,"" he said.

Mr Andrews and Dr Sutton said it could force healthcare workers to stay home to care for their children instead of being where they were needed — at work.

Research so far shows children are less susceptible to the virus, and Dr Sutton said there were questions about whether placing them into the broader community with potentially immunocompromised people could pose a risk.

Mr Andrews echoed earlier warnings about the virus's impact and said it was almost inevitable schools would close as cases climbed.

The ACT Government has announced a range of changes to city services in response to a temporary shutdown of non-essential services in the ACT.

Libraries ACT

Libraries ACT will close all its nine library branches as well as the ACT Heritage Library to public access from tomorrow, Wednesday 25 March 2020.

For members of the community who need to access essential services such as computers, printers and photocopiers, access can be arranged by contacting Libraries ACT on 6205 9000. Access to these services will only be made available at the Woden, Dickson and Gungahlin branches by pre-arranged bookings.

Items currently on loan have had their due dates extended until the end of April 2020. Library chutes will remain open as per normal operating hours and library items can be renewed online or by phone on 6205 9000.

Library members can continue to access eBooks, eAudio, digital magazines, Story Box Library and other eResources on the Libraries ACT website using their membership number and passphrase.

In addition to these closures, the home library service will be postponed until further notice.

Cemeteries and crematoria

Gungahlin, Woden and Hall cemeteries are still open for visitors who wish to visit their loved one’s grave or memorial. People must follow the social distancing guidelines when they visit including staying 1.5 metres away from any other visitors.

Funeral services can still be held in the ACT, but must have no more than 10 people in attendance and observe the social distancing guidelines including having one person per 4 square metres. Canberra Cemeteries is continuing to work closely with the funeral industry to ensure these requirements are met.

Canberra Cemeteries has changed the way it delivers its services, with its head office currently closed to the public. Burial services are continuing as usual. For residents of the ACT who have a death in the family, most necessary arrangements with funeral directors, cemeteries and the crematorium can be made over the phone and online. We encourage families to contact their service provider for more information.

If you need to make any arrangements, please contact the Customer Service Team on 6204 0200 or email us at cemeteries@act.gov.au. Forms are digitally available and can be accessed via the Canberra Cemeteries website under the ‘forms and downloads’ tab.

Waste and recycling

Residential red and yellow bin collections are now starting from 5 am. There is currently no change to the start times of green bin collections which will remain as 7 am.

The ACT’s waste and recycling drop-off facilities including the Container Deposit Scheme return points, resource management centres and recycling drop off centres are operating as normal. Please note, however, that the weighbridges at the Mitchell and Mugga Resource Management Centres, Soft Landings mattress recycling and the Green Shed are not accepting cash payments, please use the eftpos facilities.

The community can access a range of digital resources at www.act.gov.au/recycling.

Domestic Animal Services

The Domestic Animal Services (DAS) shelter in Symonston is closed to the general public until further notice.

The shelter will remain staffed to care for the dogs in DAS’ care and allow people to collect their impounded dog if they phone ahead through Access Canberra on 13 22 81. If you are interested in re-homing a dog please also call Access Canberra within business hours. No cash payments will be accepted.

DAS Rangers will continue to respond to call outs for community safety.

Yarralumla Nursery

The ACT Government’s wholesale nursey located at Yarralumla is closed to the general public for the Plant Issue Scheme and wholesale sales until further notice.

If you have a wholesale order at the government’s nursery ready for collection, please contact them as soon as possible on 6207 2447 or at yarr.nursery@act.gov.au before visiting the site to book an order collection time. No cash payments will be accepted.

The government’s nursery will remain staffed to continue to maintain and irrigate the plants on site.

The Retail Garden Centre at the Heritage Nursery remains open for business.

Birrigai

Birrigai outdoor school is closed to the public until further notice.

Infrastructure projects

We are working closely with our contractors, suppliers and industry partners to mitigate delays to our infrastructure program as much as possible over the coming months. This is an active and ongoing conversation, particularly in light of the social distancing requirements recently enforced. Any changes to project timeframes will be communicated with the public once known.

The ACT Government will be enacting directions on the temporary closure of non-essential activities and businesses to help slow the spread of COVID-19. This reflects the decision made at National Cabinet on non-essential service closures and maintains consistency with the NSW Government approach. It is important that the rules are the same throughout the Canberra region.

Unfortunately too many members of the community are ignoring social distancing measures, and by doing so, are putting the lives of older and vulnerable Canberrans at risk.

Risk reduction is paramount. If we want to slow the spread of COVID-19 we need to implement social distancing at all non-essential places of social gathering.

Despite measures in place to discourage social interaction, there are still too many instances where people are exposing themselves to contracting the virus which is leading to an unsustainable increase in confirmed cases across the country.

This means following the law and keeping at least 1.5 metres away from other people.

Case update in the ACT

The ACT Chief Health Officer, Dr Kerryn Coleman, has announced 13 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the ACT’s total to 32 as at midday today.

The new cases include 5 males and 8 females, aged between 14 and 83 years of age. This includes the student at Lyneham High School identified last night.

This increase is largely related to Canberrans returning home from overseas travel and some close household contacts of previous cases.

ACT Health is contacting their close contacts as a priority and will continue working to ensure they are all informed of their self-quarantine requirements.

There have been 2,576 negative COVID-19 tests in the ACT as at midday on Monday, 23 March.

There are currently three (3) COVID-19 patients being cared for in hospital in Canberra, including one new case. The remainder of the current cases are isolating at home with the support of ACT Health.

ACT Health is continuing to take appropriate public health action in line with national guidelines.

Businesses to close

For the ACT, an important guide to our local decision making is the need for rules to be the same throughout the Canberra region, particularly in relation to the closure of businesses and activities. A business that is allowed to continue operating in the ACT, but not in NSW due to the risk to public health, or vice-versa, would be problematic and could significantly impact on public health.

Therefore, the ACT will continue to work closely with NSW in responding to this public health crisis.

In regards to the shutting down of non-essential services to protect public health, the ACT and NSW will be aligned.

For the ACT, this includes:

Pubs & registered clubs

Gyms & indoor sporting venues

Cinemas, entertainment venues, casinos and night clubs

Restaurants and cafes will be restricted to takeaway and/or home delivery

Religious gatherings & places of worship (excluding small weddings and funerals that comply with the 4m2 rules)

Any businesses and places of work that do not fall in this list may continue at this point. However, just because certain industries and businesses can currently continue operation, it does not mean it is business as usual.

Our community must now adapt across all environments, including the workplace, to help slow the spread of the virus. If we don’t, more onerous and restrictive measures will be introduced.

Physical distancing measures and frequent hand washing must be strongly encouraged across all workplaces and business owners must take necessary measures to ensure their employees are closely following these measures.

Any business that can transition to virtual work arrangements should start that process as soon as possible.

ACT schools update

Already today many parents have chosen to keep their children at home.

We are having pupil free days so that schools can prepare to transition to alternative methods of delivering education for our children, however no child will be turned away from ACT public schools tomorrow.

The ACT school system is prepared to transition to alternative teaching models from term 2. Government schools are well placed for this shift, having invested significantly in devices for students and digital capability over recent years.

Our teachers will use this time to design learning plans for students. We ask that you give them some space to do this work, as it will position us to best support your child’s continued education.

That said – we understand that in some cases this will not be possible, and no child will be turned away from our schools.

We will continue to work with school communities as we transition to providing schooling options for school-age children whose parents and carers must be at work directly supporting essential responses to Covid-19. This includes teachers, aged care and health services workers.

Aged care directions

The outbreak of any virus in an aged care facility can have catastrophic consequences. We also know that COVID-19 is a particular health risk for older people in our community.

As of 5pm tonight, 23 March 2020 visits to residential aged care facilities in the ACT will be restricted. Only the following visitors will be allowed in addition to employees, contractors, service providers and emergency responders:

care and support visits limited to one visit per day of no longer than two hours made to the resident by one person, or two persons together; and

visitors providing end of life support to loved ones.

People who are unwell with a fever, have arrived in Australia from overseas within the last 14 days, have come into contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 or do not have an up-to-date influenza vaccination (when available) will not be permitted to enter an aged care facility.

Young people under 16 years of age will only be permitted in an aged care facility for compassionate reasons for the purposes of visiting someone at end of life.

General advice

For people who are being asked to self-quarantine, there is comprehensive advice on the ACT Health website (www.health.act.gov.au), which we ask you to follow.

We also encourage all Canberrans to continue to stay up to date on developments through the ACT Health website and through the ACT Health social media channels.

People who are concerned and want further information on the virus, can contact the Australian Government’s Coronavirus Health Information Line on 1800 020 080. The line operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

The ACT Chief Health Officer, Dr Kerryn Coleman, has this afternoon provided an update on the fourth confirmed case of COVID-19 in the ACT.

The individual is a female in her 20s. She recently returned from overseas where we believe she has been exposed to the novel coronavirus.

She has complied with self-quarantining directions for travellers returning from overseas and is now isolating with ACT Health support.

A small number of household close contacts have been identified and contacted this afternoon.

There are also a number of travel close contacts we are working to identify.

Travel close contacts:

ACT Health has identified one international flight and one domestic flight, where potential exposure may have occurred as the individual has travelled back to Canberra from overseas. ACT Health will be working with national authorities to identify individuals who are close contacts as a priority. We are alerting any Canberrans while this work is underway.

People in rows 71-75 on flight QF94 from Los Angeles to Melbourne, which arrived at 8.30am on 17 March, are considered close contacts.

People in rows 15-19 of QF2130 from Melbourne to Canberra, departing at noon and arriving at 1.30pm on 17 March, are considered close contacts.

Any Canberrans sitting in these rows are asked to quarantine themselves and call the Communicable Disease Control Section of ACT Health on (02) 5124 9213 for further advice.

Anyone else travelling on these flights in other rows are not considered to be a close contact, and as a precaution, should monitor their health until 31 March. Self-quarantine is not required.

ACT Health is continuing to take appropriate public health action in line with national guidelines.

There are currently four confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the ACT, with 1,853 negative tests so far.

For people who are being asked to self-quarantine, there is comprehensive advice on the ACT Health website (www.health.act.gov.au), which we ask you to follow.

We also encourage all Canberrans to continue to stay up to date on developments through the website and ACT Health social media channels.

The program of events at all nine public library branches and the ACT Heritage Library has been suspended from tomorrow, Thursday 19 March 2020, until further notice.

While the program of events has been suspended, all public library branches and the ACT Heritage Library are currently open as per normal operating hours.

The decision to suspend the program of events has been made for the safety of staff and the community due to the difficulty in maintaining social distancing recommendations during many of the events and given the drop in attendance experienced in the last week. It also follows the Council of Australian Government’s recommendation limiting all non-essential indoor gatherings of 100 or more people.

Some events require people to register, and we are getting in touch with these people to advise them of the suspension.

We are exploring how to deliver some library programs online, where possible, and will provide further information on alternative delivery options on the Libraries ACT website and social media.

Hire of the community rooms at all library branches has also been suspended until further notice.

If you are unwell, please do not visit the library. You can continue to access eBooks, eAudio, digital magazines, Story Box Library and other eResources online using your library membership number and passphrase. You can also renew items online or by phone on 6205 9000.

We have identified several family and travel close contacts. As part of our contact tracing, ACT Health is making contact with these individuals today.

Travel close contacts:

ACT Health has identified one flight and a bus trip where potential may have occurred as the individual has travelled back to Canberra from overseas. ACT Health will be working with the airline and the bus company to identify individuals who are close contacts as a priority. We are also alerting any Canberrans while this work is underway.

People in rows 41-45 on flight GA712 from Jakarta to Sydney, which arrived at 9.30am on 14 March, is considered a close contact.

Any Canberrans sitting in these rows are asked to quarantine themselves and call the Communicable Disease Control Section of ACT Health on (02) 5124 9213 for further advice.

Anyone else travelling on this flight in other rows are not considered to be close contacts, and as a precaution, monitor their health until 28 March. Self-quarantine is not required.

People who travelled on a Murrays bus from Sydney Airport to Canberra, departing at 12.25pm on 14 March, is also considered a close contact.

All Canberrans on this bus is considered a close contact and should quarantine themselves and call the Communicable Disease Control Section of ACT Health (details above) for further advice.

ACT Health is continuing to take appropriate public health action in line with national guidelines. All identified close contacts will be contacted by ACT Health.

For people who are being asked to self-quarantine, there is comprehensive advice on the ACT Health website (www.health.act.gov.au), which we ask you to follow.

We also encourage all Canberrans to continue to stay up to date on developments through the website and ACT Health social media channels.

Local groups and individuals can apply for grants up to $35,000 as part of the 2020–2021 round of the ACT Environment Grants program.

ACT Environment Grants provide financial support to implement community-based projects that care for the environment and strengthen people’s connection to nature.

This year’s program will incorporate an additional funding stream and increase investment from $218,000 to a total of $285,000.

The additional funding will help local groups and individuals enhance ecosystem health and function within the urban built environment and will help support the Government’s long-term objectives of a sustainable and resilient city.

This will encourage the community to conserve and enhance Canberra’s urban and parks landscape through project ideas that helps care for, restore and rehabilitate Canberra’s natural environment.

The ACT Government initiated this grants program in 1996 and since then, the program has supported more than 261 projects with almost $4 million in funding.

A recent independent review survey found that grant recipients emphasised the importance of the opportunities created by the grant program.

Engaging community energy and enthusiasm through the grants program is a proven way to assist Canberra’s fantastic natural resources.

The 2020–2021 ACT Environment Grants program opens today and closes at 11.59pm on Tuesday 28 April 2020.

All ACT Government irrigated sportsgrounds will be closed from Wednesday 18 March to Tuesday 31 March 2020 (inclusive) for the autumn renovations that follow the summer sports season.

This action is not in as a result of the current COVID-19 response by the ACT Government and is part of routine maintenance across the city.

“Many different sporting groups and individuals use our ovals over the summer season and, to ensure the grounds will be in just as good condition for our winter sports and activities, we need to undertake essential maintenance works,” Executive Branch Manager City Presentation, Stephen Alegria, said.

The renovation works include applying fertiliser to assist turf growth and density, aeration, top dressing of worn and uneven areas, over-sowing of bare or sparse areas to even the turf cover, and—of course—installing goal posts.

“I would like to thank all sportsground users for their patience while we undertake these essential works to our sportsgrounds,” Mr Alegria said.

The ACT Government manages 127 irrigated sportsgrounds across the Territory, equating to an area of approximately 282 hectares, with each facility hosting year-round training and competitions.

ACT sportsgrounds will reopen on Wednesday 1 April 2020.

CORONER STEWART:

Introduction

Adrian Pitman was born in 1961. There is no dispute that he died from multiple injuries after his car hit a stone retaining wall and caught on fire on Fairburn Avenue, Campbell, ACT. This happened at about 12.01 am on Tuesday 15 March 2016. The Court is aware of the sadness caused by my determination that the manner of Mr Pitman’s death was suicide by intentional motor vehicle collision. Those interim findings were made on 13 June 2019. Mr Pitman had a long history of mental illness. He had completed school and commenced studying architecture at university. Mr Pitman’s mental health declined to the point where he had a long term diagnosis of treatment-resistant schizophrenia by the time of his death. Unfortunately, by March 2016 Mr Pitman was a social recluse, was subject to a community treatment order to enforce medication regimes and he was obsessed with delusions. He had been in the care of 33 different case managers since the year 2000.

How the Coronial Jurisdiction arises

At his time of death Mr Pitman was deemed to be in custody. This is because Mr Pitman was subject to a community-based Psychiatric Treatment Order (“PTO”) through ACAT and under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act 1994 (“the MHCT Act”). Section 3C of the Coroners Act 1997 (“the CA”) dictates that when someone dies whilst subject to an order under the MHCT Act that death is deemed to be a death in custody. [The MHCT Act has now been repealed and replaced by the Mental Health Act 2015 with consequential amendments to the CA.] Section 13(1)(k) of the CA mandates that an inquest must be held when there is a death in custody – thus my jurisdiction as a Coroner is enlivened. Further, under section 34A(2), I must hold a hearing for the purposes of my inquest.

What are the issues to be determined in this inquest?

The CA sets out in sections 52(1) and 74 what must be determined by me. The s 52(1) issues of identity, time, place and manner and cause of death are not disputed. S 74 dictates as follows: 74 Findings about quality of care, treatment and supervision The coroner holding an inquest into a death in custody must include in a record of the proceedings of the inquest findings about the quality of care, treatment and supervision of the deceased that, in the opinion of the coroner, contributed to the cause of death. Short chronology I have taken this chronology largely from the statement of CONST Barlee, my coronial investigator. The references to Mr Pitman’s early life are taken from a conversation between CONST Barlee and Mr Pitman’s mother:

January 1961 Mr Pitman born.

1980 Mr Pitman left family home in ACT and moved to Sydney.

1991 Mr Pitman was admitted to hospital following psychotic episode. He was admitted for a number of weeks and then returned to the ACT to reside with his parents.

1990’s Mr Pitman diagnosed with schizophrenia and received treatment through ACT Mental Health (ACTMH).

2000 Mr Pitman moved to a one bedroom unit at Lyneham owned by his mother. His financial matters become managed by the Public Trustee. In this year his father died and he experienced increasingly severe psychotic episodes. He became involved with people at the Aboriginal Embassy and from then was also known by the name Mirri Ngunnawal. He expressed an ongoing delusional view that he could not be subject to a Psychiatric Treatment Order (PTO) as he was Aboriginal.

20 September 2000 Mr Pitman hospitalised until 13 March 2006 due to mental ill-health.

26 September 2002 Mrs Pitman advised ACTMH that Mr Pitman was in Fiji.

24 June 2003 Mr Pitman deported from Fiji and was reported to be highly delusional.

23 February 2006 Mr Pitman hospitalised until 11 October 2006 due to mental ill-health.

21 June 2011 Mr Pitman hospitalised until 12 July 2011 due to mental ill-health.

22 May 2014 Dr Garside commences the first of 14 face to face interviews with Mr Pitman.

14 January 2015 Mr Pitman was admitted to Canberra Hospital’s Adult Mental Health Unit (AMHU) psychiatric treatment ward until 30 January 2015.

22 January 2015 Six month PTO granted by ACAT.

09 July 2015 Six month PTO granted by ACAT.

22 September 2015 Mr Pitman was admitted to AMHU for about eight weeks. He had attended the offices of ASIO and reported that mental health had attempted to poison him.

16 November 2015 Mr Pitman’s symptoms had improved and he was released from hospital to the Step Up Step Down program. In accordance with his privacy requests, Mr Pitman’s family are not advised of his discharge or involved in that process. He self-discharged from Step Up Step Down six days later and refused to be admitted to Bryan Hennessey House.

17 November 2015 Mr Pitman reiterated that he did not consent to members of his family being informed about his medication and management.

23 November 2015 Ms Johnson (Mr Pitman’s final care worker and clinical manager) conducted her first home visit with Mr Pitman. His home was tidy and he was polite, but short-spoken and declined to engage in conversation about treatment. This behaviour was to be repeated in future visits.

14 January 2016 Six month PTO granted by ACAT.

21 January 2016 Dr Garside reviewed Mr Pitman who displayed a low level of self-care.

10 February 2015 Ms Johnson conducted home assessment with Mr Pitman. He did not express suicidal ideation and displayed impaired insight into his mental health.

10 March 2016 Ms Johnson spoke with Mr Pitman on the telephone to determine if he needed transport for his appointment that day.

Mr Pitman attended his appointment with Dr Garside and Ms Johnson at City Mental Health. He presented with no insight into his mental illness, but there was nothing about Mr Pitman’s presentation that caused concern to Dr Garside or Ms Johnson.

Mr Pitman was again prescribed 300mg Olanzipine every two weeks and the next review was set for June 2016.

13 March 2016 Mr Pitman and his mother enjoyed an uneventful and happy Sunday lunch.

14 March 2016 Mr Pitman was seen on supermarket CCTV footage. He later (apparently) resolved to drive to Mt Ainslie.

15 March 2016 In the first few minutes of the day Mr Pitman died after his car struck a retaining wall at the bottom of Mt Ainslie. He was declared life extinct at 3.00am that day. At about the same time a note commonly called a ‘suicide note’ was found by police in Mr Pitman’s bedroom.

Witness evidence

7. The Court received evidence from seven witnesses as well as the coronial brief. The majority of these witnesses gave evidence in relation to their dealings with Mr Pitman in a medical and clinical setting. Evidence was also given by an Assistant Director of Traffic Safety and Transport Canberra and City Services in relation to the intersection where Mr Pitman died.

Medical and Clinical Evidence

Dr Renate Mundl

8. The Court received evidence from Dr Renate Mundl. Dr Mundl was formerly an employee of ACT Health. Her work with Mr Pitman commenced on 30 November 2010, while she was working in the City Mental Health Team.

9. Dr Mundl issued Mr Pitman with two prescriptions of the drug Clozapine on 30 November 2010 and 23 February 2011. She did not see Mr Pitman prior to issuing these prescriptions and explained that Mr Pitman had previously been prescribed Clozapine and that she was simply continuing the prescription as part of an existing protocol for the issue of that drug.

10. For present purposes, Dr Mundl next dealt with Mr Pitman in 2015. At that time, she was working as a consultant at the Adult Mental Health Unit (AMHU) at The Canberra Hospital.

11. Dr Mundl assessed Mr Pitman on 30 September 2015. She assessed him as suffering from an ongoing psychosis, the effects of which had been reduced since Mr Pitman had been admitted to hospital and treated. Dr Mundl’s recommendations on this occasion were to the effect that, in order to better assess future treatment options for Mr Pitman:

(a) Further information was required about Mr Pitman’s past treatment; and

(b) It would be necessary for clinical staff to liaise with Mr Pitman’s community case manager in relation to planning for discharge.

12. Dr Mundl also dealt with Mr Pitman on 7 October 2015. On this occasion, either by her own recommendation or in collaboration with the community case manager it was suggested that Mr Pitman be put back on Clozapine. It was also noted at the time that Mr Pitman was more unwell than previously thought. Dr Mundl was unable to recall in her evidence what prompted this note to be made.

13. Dr Mundl was asked some general questions by Counsel Assisting about the type of treatment provided under Psychiatric Treatment Orders (PTO). Her evidence was that treatment under a PTO could be what was described as “bio-psycho-social”[1] – that is, such orders consist not only of medical or pharmaceutical forms of treatment, but also other forms of therapies which she described broadly as “psycho-social”. Dr Mundl noted, however, that any such therapies available under a PTO would need to be balanced against a patient’s ability to cope with whatever form of therapy was proposed. Further, such therapies were only available while the patient was housed within an “approved facility”, like the AMHU, rather than in the community at large. The reasons given for this distinction related to difficulties in forcing patient compliance while they were in the community at large.

14. Dr Mundl was also asked questions about doctor-patient confidentiality, particularly focussed on the issue of whether details of a patient’s treatment ought to be disclosed to that patient’s carer. Dr Mundl was specifically asked about whether, in a case like Mr Pitman’s where his mother was supporting his accommodation needs in the community, the patient’s carer ought to be told what the status of the patient’s care is. Dr Mundl’s answers on this topic were expressed in the hypothetical. She stated that she had not herself been in a situation where any such step was necessary. Nevertheless, her evidence was to the effect that she would attempt to advise the patient to tell their carer. Her concern in this regard was directed towards the possible effect on the patient upon interacting with their parent after discharge if the parent did not know about the discharge.

15. Dr Mundl gave general evidence that the risk of suicide is heightened for those suffering from schizophrenia. She told the inquest that in treating people like Mr Pitman, suicide risk was assessed, inter alia, as part of a standard set of interview questions, involving both direct and indirect questioning. In cases like Mr Pitman’s, his affect – described as “blunted” with little or no insight – was such that the treating professionals would have had to rely more heavily on indirect questioning.

16. Counsel Assisting described the behaviour of Mr Pitman observed by his mother on the morning prior to his death. Dr Mundl noted that the behaviour described was consistent with what appeared in some medical literature as “pre-suicidal syndrome”. However, as was clarified during questioning by Counsel for the Territory, Dr Mundl conceded that this answer was only hypothetical, and that she could not say that Mr Pitman did suffer from any such condition.

17. Dr Mundl was asked questions about her experience from other jurisdictions. In particular, she was asked whether her experience of other jurisdictions could shed light on the treatment of mental health in the ACT. She briefly canvassed her experience in Austria, Victoria and South Australia. Dr Mundl noted briefly that in Austria there are no community treatment orders because of legal and geographical differences. In the Australian context, Dr Mundl commented that, in her experience, the level of communication in the ACT mental health system was superior to the other jurisdictions. She qualified this statement by noting that she was not sure whether this difference was due to a difference in culture or legal framework.

18. When asked if she could make any recommendations for improvements to the mental health system in the ACT, Dr Mundl focussed on resourcing constraints, and an apparent disjunct between in-patient care and community care. However, she did not consider in hindsight that there was anything different that she would have done in Mr Pitman’s case.

Ms Annaliese Johnson

19. Ms Johnson was Mr Pitman’s clinical manager while he was being treated in the community from November 2015 to March 2016. Her formal training was as a social worker.

20. Ms Johnson saw Mr Pitman at least once a fortnight when he attended the City Mental Health offices for his fortnightly medication injection. Almost every week in between, Ms Johnson would have a short phone call with Mr Pitman. She also visited his home once a month.

21. The questions asked of Ms Johnson canvassed a range of topics.

22. Ms Johnson was asked about Mr Pitman’s decision to discharge himself from the Step Up Step Down (“SUSD”) program. That program is a voluntary residential program established to enable persons in intensive in-patient care for mental illness to transition back into the community. When Ms Johnson became Mr Pitman’s clinical manager she knew that he was coming from that facility. As far as she understood, his reason for discharging himself was his belief that he did not need to be there anymore. Ms Johnson did not form a view at that time about Mr Pitman’s decision to leave SUSD.

23. Following conversations that Ms Johnson had with Mrs Pitman about the challenge in maintaining Mr Pitman’s apartment, Ms Johnson offered to organise a cleaner for Mr Pitman’s apartment. Mr Pitman initially agreed to Ms Johnson making some enquiries. Some weeks later, when the matter was raised with Mr Pitman again after Ms Johnson had identified an appropriate service, Mr Pitman indicated that he did not wish to proceed. He offered that Ms Johnson attend his apartment to confirm that he did not need any assistance. Ms Johnson attended the apartment in November. She commented that, at the time of her visit, it was tidy and sparsely furnished, with a slight odour of cigarette smoke. Thereafter, Ms Johnson would attend Mr Pitman’s apartment approximately once per month. She did not observe much of a change to the state of the apartment. She formed the view that his refusal of assistance was reasonable. Ms Johnson conceded that she did not check the cupboards for clutter that had been put away perhaps in anticipation of her visit.

24. Ms Johnson was also responsible for submitting an application for Mr Pitman to receive support under the National Disability Insurance Scheme (“NDIS”). NDIS has the potential to offer psychosocial support to persons experiencing mental illness. However, Mr Pitman expressed that he did not have a desire for social interaction outside of his interactions with elders at the Aboriginal Tent Embassy. When asked if she had a concern about this lack of willingness to socialise, Ms Johnson responded that the lack of desire for social interaction was consistent with the diagnosis of schizophrenia.

25. During her fortnightly telephone conversations with Mr Pitman, Ms Johnson would attempt to assess Mr Pitman’s mood and behaviour. She would ask certain questions periodically, such as whether Mr Pitman thought life was worth living, or whether he had any thoughts about harming himself or others. However, such questions were not asked commonly, because, on Ms Johnson’s evidence, it would be something that would generally be asked only if there had been some change in circumstances. In Mr Pitman’s case, however, Ms Johnson indicated that she would only ask those questions “if it had been quite some time since they had been asked, because that was really the only indicator to ask them as a matter of routine”.

26. According to Ms Johnson, Mr Pitman’s mental state was roughly consistent during the period that she was his clinical manager. Had there been any evidence of deterioration, she would have discussed it with the multidisciplinary team.

27. Ms Johnson was asked about whether she held any instructions from Mr Pitman in relation to the engagement of Mr Pitman’s family – particularly, his mother Maureen. She deposed that she was only instructed to discuss with Mr Pitman’s family the state of his flat upon visits. Mr Pitman did not give her instructions to share progress about his condition.

28. Ms Johnson’s final interaction with Mr Pitman was on 10 March 2016, during a review with Dr Joseph Garside. Dr Garside’s assessment at that review was that Mr Pitman’s “presentation seemed quite consistent with what he would expect when Mr Pitman was reasonably well, as in not in an escalated state with his mental illness”. Nothing on this occasion gave Ms Johnson any cause for concern. I note that this was only five days prior to his passing.

29. Ms Johnson did not think that there was anything that, in hindsight, she would have done differently. She also stated that she thought the policies and guidelines available to her at the time were sufficient, and that she felt she had sufficient support.

Dr Joseph Garside

30. Dr Garside is a senior clinical medical officer practising as a psychiatrist at ACT City Mental Health. He was Mr Pitman’s treating psychiatrist in the community, and was responsible for Mr Pitman’s care between 22 May 2014 and 10 March 2016.

31. Focussing on the period when Mr Pitman was admitted to the AMHU, Dr Garside gave evidence that he was made aware of Mr Pitman’s discharge to the SUSD program. He deposed that, while he was aware, he had not been consulted about this decision to discharge Mr Pitman. He stated that, while ideally he would have been part of that decision-making process, the discharge plan did not cause him any concern.

32. Dr Garside was asked a number of questions about whether it would have been an option for Mr Pitman to be sent to undertake a period of rehabilitation at Brian Hennessy House (“BHH”) (also referred to during the inquest as the Brian Hennessy Rehabilitation Centre). Dr Garside’s evidence was that while it was possible to make it a condition of Mr Pitman’s PTO that he reside at BHH, the purpose of BHH is as a rehabilitation unit. As such, it requires a willingness on the part of the patient to comply. Mr Pitman could not have been forced to participate in the activities directed towards rehabilitation. Although a PTO could be used to compel a person to attend such activities, forced compliance would be out of line with the model of imposing the least restrictive form of care, for non-compliance could result in the person being taken to hospital. Further, Dr Garside noted that due to the fact that Mr Pitman usually kept to himself, he could not say whether forcing Mr Pitman to reside at BHH would actually have made him engage with others.

33. When asked why he did not discuss the possibility of going to BHH with Mr Pitman on a number of occasions, Dr Garside stated that Mr Pitman was not open to having a discussion about residential rehabilitation. In order for the suggestion to be made, Mr Pitman would have had to displace some “willingness to accept support and some awareness that there may be some advantage to entering into a rehabilitation process”. Dr Garside’s clinical judgment was that Mr Pitman would be dismissive of such a suggestion.

34. Counsel Assisting raised with Dr Garside the question as to whether Mr Pitman was capable of making decisions regarding the disclosure of information to his family members. Mr Pitman generally consented to only a limited sharing of information about his interaction with his medical and clinical team with his family. When asked if he thought it was appropriate that Mr Pitman could direct his medical and clinical team not to disclose updates about his condition to his mother, Dr Garside stated that such a restriction was appropriate, and that the fact that Mr Pitman had a chronic illness did not deny him the right to confidentiality. The fact that, in order for a PTO to be made Dr Garside suggested that such lack of capacity is only in relation to the mental illness itself, rather than decision-making capacity more broadly. Dr Garside stated that the factors which are taken into account when deciding to make a PTO do not necessarily look at a person’s capacity to make decisions in other dimensions of that person’s life. More particularly, while no formal testing was done, Dr Garside deposed that there was nothing which caused him to doubt Mr Pitman’s ability to make decisions.

35. When asked follow-up questions about whether Mr Pitman was capable of making the decision about not going to BHH, Dr Garside stated that Mr Pitman knew what it would have meant to go to BHH in terms of taking him away from the things in his life that he wanted to pursue at that point in time. His evidence was that there was nothing to be gained by being more restrictive in Mr Pitman’s care.

36. Dr Garside was asked questions about whether directly addressing issues of suicide or self-harm increased the risk of Mr Pitman entertaining suicidal thoughts. Dr Garside did not believe that asking Mr Pitman about suicide would have put the idea in his head. His evidence was to the effect that Mr Pitman had not previously attempted suicide, and the manifestations of his “delusional system” did not suggest that suicide would be one of the ways in which that system played out. Mr Pitman showed a sense of future purpose.

37. Dr Garside was asked if he could make any recommendations for the improvement of mental care for those in Mr Pitman’s position. He stated that he would like to see the provision of more services, along with a change of mindset, in the community.

Dr Alfiya Mutlu

38. Dr Mutlu is a psychiatrist working for ACT Health. She was involved in Mr Pitman’s care while he was an in-patient at AMHU at The Canberra Hospital.

39. On 23 September 2015, she conducted a review of Mr Pitman. He stated at the time that his life was over. When asked whether she thought that indicated any suicidal ideation on Mr Pitman’s part, she stated that her interpretation was that it was not an indication of increased suicide risk. Her impression was that the danger to his life was from some external cause, which would have been consistent with certain delusional thoughts he was having at the time of his admission.

Dr Astika Kappagoda

40. Dr Kappagoda is a practising psychiatry registrar, who was formerly employed by ACT Health. His interactions with Mr Pitman were while Mr Pitman was admitted as an in-patient in the AMHU.

41. Dr Kappagoda first saw Mr Pitman on 25 September 2015, during which Dr Kappagoda assessed Mr Pitman’s mental state. His evidence was that Mr Pitman appeared agitated, suspicious and guarded about giving information. He walked out of the interview before a full assessment could take place. When asked whether he had concerns about Mr Pitman’s ability to make decisions about non-medical issues, he stated that, at that point in time, Mr Pitman’s level of thought disorder caused him to make a reasonable assumption that Mr Pitman’s decision-making capacity across a variety of domains would be severely affected. It should be noted that it was clarified during examination by Counsel for the Territory that, because there was no formal cognitive assessment, Dr Kappagoda was not able to form a final view as to Mr Pitman’s capacity to make decisions. Furthermore, later during the course of his admission in the AMHU, Dr Kappagoda held the opinion that Mr Pitman had the capacity to make a decision regarding the disclosure of information about his treatment to his family.

42. Dr Kappagoda deposed that, during the course of his interactions with Mr Pitman, he observed that Mr Pitman became more forthcoming in discussing his thoughts and concerns with his treating team. His evidence was that this was a possible indication that the medication that had been prescribed – Olanzapine – was starting to take effect.

43. Dr Kappagoda attended a meeting with Mr Pitman and his mother on 15 October 2015. Mrs Pitman expressed concerns about Mr Pitman’s capacity to live at the apartment she provided for him. The possibility of a period of time at BHH was proposed to Mr Pitman, which he rejected. After a sustained discussion, as an alternative to BHH, Mr Pitman agreed to participate in the SUSD program,

44. Following Mr Pitman’s discharge from the AMHU, Dr Kappagoda had discussions with Mrs Pitman, who expressed surprise at Mr Pitman’s discharge. Dr Kappagoda stated that it would have been ideal to include her in the discharge planning, but that that was contrary to Mr Pitman’s wishes. He noted to Mrs Pitman that the team responsible for Mr Pitman’s care in the community should consider applying for an order to ACAT for Mr Pitman to reside at BHH. He stated that he did not consider making an application for this order himself, because Mr Pitman’s overall mental state and organisation had seemed to improve during his time at the AMHU, such that Dr Kappagoda wanted to see if there would be some further functional recovery that would not make such an order necessary.

45. When asked if there was anything he would have done differently in relation to Mr Pitman’s care, Dr Kappagoda stated that opportunities to involve family members in patient care were more limited than he would have liked. Nevertheless, he was of the view that the in-patient team provided Mr Pitman with medical treatment that benefited his mental state, and provided the community team with sufficient informational to enable his care to be effective after discharge.

46. In suggesting any recommendations for reform, Dr Kappagoda stated he would like to see “more guidance under what circumstances a patient’s privacy can be breached in the interests of advancing their care.”

Dr Florian Wertenauer

47. Dr Wertenauer is a practising psychiatrist, and was previously the director of Adult Acute Mental Health Services at The Canberra Hospital.

48. Dr Wertenauer was asked a number of questions relating to his treatment of Mr Pitman during his admission at the AMHU. A number of these questions focussed on the topic of Mr Pitman’s mental state following his discharge from the AMHU. Counsel Assisting asked Dr Wertenauer whether, had Mr Pitman not agreed to participate in the SUSD program, a decision would have been made to discharge Mr Pitman straight into the community. Dr Wertenauer’s evidence was to the effect that if Mr Pitman had not agreed to go to SUSD, he would not have been discharged at that point from the AMHU. Dr Wertenauer was subsequently asked whether he considered that Mr Pitman was capable of forming a plan of agreeing to participate in the SUSD program, and then discharging himself, as actually occurred. Dr Wertenauer’s evidence was that Mr Pitman was capable of forming such a plan. Dr Wertenauer clarified his evidence by subsequently stating that part of the plan in discharging Mr Pitman to SUSD was to enable him to try residential rehabilitation, and that Mr Pitman needed to be willing to participate.

Mr Pawel Potapowicz

49. Mr Potapowicz is an Assistant Director of Traffic Safety at Transport Canberra and City Services. He conducted checks of Roads ACT records in relation to vehicle suicide risk at the intersection of Mount Ainslie Drive and Fairbairn Avenue in Campbell. Prior to Mr Pitman’s death at that site, the rea was not known to be an intersection where there was a high risk of vehicle or crash-related suicides.

50. No action was taken in relation to this site following Mr Pitman’s death on 15 March 2016. On 1 August 2017, another death occurred which was found subsequently by a Coroner to be a suicide attempt. There was also another attempted suicide at the site on 6 August 2017.

51. Following these events, temporary traffic measures were implemented on 11 August 2017. Consequently, a report was commissioned by Roads ACT for the recommendation of permanent measures. Work on the project, acting on the recommendations of the report, commenced on 12 May 2019.

52. At the time Mr Potapowicz gave his testimony, the substantive works on this intersection were mostly complete. A number of measures had been put in place for the purposes of traffic management in this area. Of note are the introduction of a permanent chicane, a deflection on the road on the approach to the intersection Fairbairn Avenue, greater street lighting, extensive line marking and a speed limit reduction.`

53. In my view these measures have satisfied public safety concerns arising out of this incident.

Submissions

54. The inquest received detailed, accurate and helpful written submissions from Counsel Assisting, Counsel for the Territory and the family of Mr Pitman. They have all been considered. There is a very clear tension between the ‘least restrictive’ approach of ACT Mental Health and a loving family who did not wish to see Mr Pitman repeatedly returned to isolation and poor self-care in his flat at Lyneham. There is also an understandable level of frustration at the privacy afforded to Mr Pitman.

Quality of care, treatment and supervision by the Adult Mental Health Unit (AMHU)

55. The evidence disclosed that Mr Pitman was a challenging patient to treat. He had little or no insight into his illness and appeared to have a broad ongoing capacity to entertain his delusions. The nine months that Mr Pitman spent in Fiji prior to his deportation in June 2003 would have been a frightening experience for his family, but were no doubt fuelled by delusion on his part (and a capacity to access his pension).

56. Mr Pitman was also very resistant to treatment of any type – including any attempts to get him to socialise or into residential treatment. This represented further challenges for AMHU in their attempts to increase his quality of life. My overall view is that there was a desire to improve Mr Pitman’s situation, but that his resistance made those attempts almost futile.

57. Prior to Mr Pitman’s release from AMHU in November 2015 the options for residential care were canvassed. He agreed to enter the Step Up Step Down program, but refused to be voluntarily admitted to Bryan Hennessey House. The witnesses agreed that forcing Mr Pitman to attend Bryan Hennessey House was possible, but would have been counter-productive for him and possibly the other residents as well. It should be remembered that Mr Pitman did not accept his diagnosis and did not believe that he was subject to the jurisdiction of ACAT, the PTO or anyone else who treated him. There was no evidence that suggested there was merit for an admission on such a basis.

58. Mr Pitman was subject to regular psychiatric review and by virtue of the PTO had to attend City Mental Health each fortnight for medication. His home was visited regularly and, amongst other things, this ensured that his living standard was monitored. As well as these face to face contacts there were multi-disciplinary reviews held for his benefit.

59. Ultimately, upon review of all of the evidence I find that there was no indication of Mr Pitman forming an intention to take his own life other than his private preparations during the day prior. Those who treated him and his family were not aware of those preparations or his intention. Mr Pitman must have intended that.

60. The extraordinary number of workers that Mr Pitman had received the care of over the years was a shock to me. Common sense would dictate that it would be preferable to have greater consistency or length of tenure in clinical managers, but this should not be taken as negative comment. Rather, it is a matter that I simply draw to the attention of ACT Health.

61. Overall, my view is that there was nothing in the quality of care treatment and supervision of Mr Pitman pre or post release from the AMHU that contributed to Mr Pitman’s death.

Privacy v family notification

62. Mr Pitman’s family set out why they were frustrated by a lack of information being passed to them. The most obvious example of this was when Mr Pitman was discharged from the AMHU on 16 November 2016 and they were not notified of this fact (Mr Pitman himself had directed that his family were not to be notified of this).

63. We have the benefit of being in a human rights jurisdiction and s12 of the Human Rights Act 2004 (HRA) applied to Mr Pitman – he had the right not to have his privacy, family, home or correspondence interfered with unlawfully or arbitrarily.

64. Clearly for Mr Pitman, ACAT had decided to waive his right to choose about whether or not he was medicated. This is very different to waiving his right to privacy.

65. The situation as at March 2016 was that Mr Pitman’s family, and in particular his mother, were able to communicate one-way with those who treated Mr Pitman. That is, Mrs Pitman shared her concerns with the treatment team regularly, but they did not respond with any information about his treatment or care.

66. I have great sympathy for Mrs Pitman’s position. She obviously loved her son and was also quite fearful that she would die and leave him without her strong family advocacy. She had been very generous in the initial provision of and later repairs to Mr Pitman’s home. It must have been very hurtful for her to be excluded by her son from his confidential medical matters – all the more so because of her professional experience in this area.

67. All of those who treated Mr Pitman formed a view that he had capacity to make decisions about the confidentiality of his medical issues. The Health Records (Privacy and Access) Act 1997 reinforced his position by law. In Principle 6 to Schedule B of that Act, the legislature has made it clear that compassionate disclosure cannot be made without a reasonable belief that the patient would expect disclosure and only in circumstances where the patient had not expressed a view contrary to disclosure in the past.

68. There was overwhelming evidence at the inquest of Mr Pitman’s expressed desire to maintain confidentiality over his medical issues and treatment.

69. In these circumstances I can make no criticism of any failure to disclose to Mr Pitman’s family.

Matters of public safety

70. Because of the changes that Roads ACT have made to the intersection of Mt Ainslie Drive and Fairburn Avenue Campbell since March 2016 I find that there is no longer a public safety issue at that intersection. There are no further public safety issues or recommendations arising from this inquest.

Cause of death

71. I confirm my earlier interim findings:

ADRIAN NICHOLAS PITMAN (born 1961) died on 15 March 2016 from multiple injuries due to a motor vehicle collision with a retaining wall which occurred at the intersection of Mt Ainslie Drive and Fairburn Avenue, Campbell, in the Australian Capital Territory. The manner of Mr Pitman’s death was suicide, in that the collision was caused by Mr Pitman with the intention of ending his own life.

Recommendation

72. That given her unique combination of health industry experience and personal experience, Mrs Pitman be expressly consulted as part of the development of the Operational Procedure on Discharge of a Person from MHJADS Adult Inpatient Unit – Sharing Information with Carers, discussed in the statement of Michelle Hemming at Exhibit F.

73. I direct that copies of my findings and my recommendation be forwarded to the Ministers for Health and Transport, and the Directors-General of the ACT Health Directorate and Transport Canberra and City Services, for their information and action.

74. I direct that these findings be published in due course on the Coroner’s Court website, together with any response received from Government.

75. I extend my condolences to Mrs Pitman, family and friends.","The references to Mr Pitman’s early life are taken from a conversation between CONST Barlee and Mr Pitman’s mother:January 1961 Mr Pitman born.

The ACT Government will delay the rollout of the Network 19 update that was due to be implemented at the start of Term 2, and begin a range of measures to ensure the safety of staff and the community.

“Canberrans are experiencing significant changes to daily routines as a result of COVID-19. Our focus must be on trying maintain services as far as possible and not creating confusion during this time by changing the bus timetable,” Minister for Transport Chris Steel said.

“Transport Canberra will continue to operate the current bus and light rail timetable for the time being, with contingencies prepared should there be a need to reduce services due to COVID-19. We will implement the Network 19 update at an appropriate time in the future.

“While bus and light rail services are continuing we are urging the community to only use them if absolutely necessary.

“Public transport services are essential for many in our community to get to the shops, to appointments or to work in essential services themselves.

“What we’re asking Canberrans to do is consider carefully their need for non-essential travel on public transport, to minimise unnecessary contact with other people.

“Canberrans should not use public transport if they feel unwell. If you have COVID-19 symptoms and have no other means of transport to get to a centre for testing, please contact Healthdirect on 1800 022 222 to arrange alternative travel.”

Commencing today the following changes are also in effect on buses in the interest of community and driver safety:



No cash – drivers will no longer be accepting cash until further notice. This is to avoid unnecessary close interactions with the driver. Please use MyWay or pre-purchased tickets from ticket vending machines.

Use of rear doors – customers are to enter and exit the bus via the rear doors at all stops unless you require the front doors for low flor access.

Closure of front seats – the front seats of the bus will temporarily be closed off, providing more space between our drivers and customers.

The ACT Government recognises the immediate support needed for Canberra artists who have lost their income and ability to maintain their arts practice as a result of COVID-19.

As part of a whole of Government response to the impacts of COVID-19, the Government has announced ‘Homefront’ a survival package for Canberra’s artists and creatives.

Funding of up to $10,000 per artist will be available to support arts development and the sustainability of their arts practices over the next 6-9 months. A total of $500,000 will be available.

Minister for the Arts, Creative Industries and Cultural Events Gordon Ramsay said that this new funding is being made available as soon as possible subject to a streamlined assessment process.

“For artists the process to apply for funding will be similar to the up to $5,000 funding rounds that the Government administers throughout the year,” Minister Ramsay said.

“This new program is designed to save as many local jobs as possible as our community and economy adjusts to this difficult and changing environment.

“The Government is a great supporter of Canberra’s creative industry and I’m glad that this package will provide essential and immediate relief to our creative sector.

“I encourage Canberra artists to remain vigilant, patient and understanding as we continue to guide and assist them through this period.”

Further information on funding is available at www.arts.act.gov.au and additional information will also be distributed via the artsACT e-newsletter.

If you are not already subscribed to the newsletter you can do this via the artsACT website.

Funding will be for activities including research and development, making of new works or sharing of works via online platforms, and for artists fees and living expenses to undertake arts activities.

Artists may also apply for the creation and development of works to be exhibited or performed in public venues in the future, when it becomes safe to undertake these activities.

Applicants will need to provide:

· a statement outlining how the funding will support their arts development and practice;

a brief bio; and

a current CV.

Applications will open on 30 March 2020 and will close on 17 April 2020 at 5pm.

Announcements on successful recipients will be made approximately 1 May 2020.

The ACT Government will be enacting directions on the temporary closure of non-essential activities and businesses to help slow the spread of COVID-19. This reflects the decision made at National Cabinet on non-essential service closures and maintains consistency with the NSW approach. It is important that the rules are the same throughout the Canberra region.

The ACT supports the National Cabinet model, and we agree that a level of consistency across jurisdictions will allow the National Cabinet to provide the most effective public health message to Australians.

However, this is a constantly evolving situation. Within the National Cabinet framework, states and territories will occasionally need to make decisions based on their own local circumstances.

For the ACT, an important guide to our local decision making is the need for rules to be the same throughout the Canberra region, particularly in relation to the closure of businesses and activities. A business that is allowed to continue operating in the ACT, but not in NSW due to the risk to public health would be problematic and could significantly impact on public health.

Therefore, the ACT will continue to work closely with NSW in responding to this public health crisis.

In regards to the shutting down of non-essential services to protect public health, the ACT and NSW will be aligned.

For the ACT, this includes:

Pubs & Registered Clubs

Gyms & indoor sporting venues

Cinemas, entertainment venues, casinos and night clubs

Restaurants and cafes will be restricted to takeaway and/or home delivery

Religious gatherings & places of worship (excluding small weddings and funerals that comply with the 4m2 rules)

Any businesses and places of work that do not fall in this list may continue at this point. However, just because certain industries and businesses can currently continue operation, it does not mean it is business as usual.

Our community must now adapt across all environments, including the workplace, to help slow the spread of the virus. If we don’t, more onerous and restrictive measures will be introduced.

Physical distancing measures and frequent hand washing must be strongly encouraged across all workplaces and business owners must take necessary measures to ensure their employees are closely following these measures.

Any business that can transition to virtual work arrangements should start that process as soon as possible.

As outlined yesterday, ACT public schools will still be able to safely receive and provide learning for the children of parents and carers engaged in essential services (such as our healthcare sector) who are unable to care for their children at home, as well as vulnerable children and those with additional needs. No child will be turned away from school. Our position is again broadly consistent with decisions made in NSW.

From this week, the ACT is moving towards a program of alternative teaching models from term 2. Government schools are well placed for this shift, after the Government invested significantly in devices for students and digital capability over recent years. Pupil free days will start in the ACT from Tuesday 24 March.

How the nation responds to the COVID-19 pandemic will profoundly change the way of life we have come to expect. The decisions being made at the National Cabinet level, and at the State and Territory level, are not easy. There are often no risk-free responses, and there are many competing priorities to balance.

This temporary closure will enable the school and health officials to work through a contact and containment strategy. This includes identifying and notifying any person who has been in recent contact with the affected person and for a thorough clean of the school.

Lyneham High School staff, students, parents and carers are not required to self-quarantine at home unless they have already been contacted directly by ACT Health. Anyone who is unwell should stay at home.

The Education Directorate is working with ACT Health to ensure the impacted members of the school community receive appropriate medical support.

The safety of students, staff and the school community is our priority.

All other schools will be open tomorrow, however pupil-free days will begin from Tuesday 24 March through to the school holidays for all schools, government and non-government.

This will provide schools and teachers with time to prepare for a range of learning delivery options, including online, similar to how distance education is provided in remote areas.

The ACT Education Directorate will provide options for school-age children whose parents and carers need to continue delivering essential services for Canberra during this period.

Schools are not closing.



The ACT school system is prepared to transition to alternative teaching models from term 2. Government schools are well placed for this shift, having invested significantly in devices for students and digital capability over recent years.

I have every confidence in the professionalism of our teaching staff and their ability to provide a quality education to our students during this period.

We want to make sure teachers, students and parents know what to expect as alternative delivery models are implemented to ensure we manage expectations and make this as seamless as possible.

I’d like to acknowledge the strength of our school communities, in particular, our teachers and school staff who have been keeping our children and young people calm, happy and learning during these extraordinary circumstances.

I’d also like to acknowledge this has been a challenging period for our families and students, and I thank you for your continued support.

Following the advice of the Commonwealth Government, the ACT Government is strongly urging Canberrans to avoid all non-essential travel outside of the Canberra region. Similar advice will be given to Australians in other states and territories.

The Government will also be immediately reviewing all public spaces across the Territory where gatherings may be occurring and closing them down. If they are on Commonwealth land, then we will be asking the Federal Government to do the same.

Stronger enforcement of self-isolation instructions to ensure people are doing the right thing and not potentially spreading the virus throughout the community will be considered at the National Cabinet this evening, with any new measures to be put in place in the Territory as soon as possible.

These are significant decisions that we are taking. We know that avoiding non-essential travel outside of the region will be difficult, and it will severely impact on the quality of life of Canberrans.

However, there should be no greater priority for our community than to work together to slow the spread of COVID-19. The number of cases in the ACT are on the rise, and Canberrans need to only look at what is happening in other countries to know what the consequences are if the nation cannot ‘flatten the curve’ of the virus.

Under this instruction, the only travel outside of the Canberra region should be for work, for ‘compassionate’ reasons and to ensure essential supplies and services.

We are urging Canberrans to take a common sense approach to this instruction, and carefully consider whether they have to travel outside of the region for any of these reasons.

The ACT Government will work with surrounding councils in the coming days to confirm these arrangements, but as a general principle – people that rely on the ACT for employment, supplies or access to health and education will be considered as part of the Canberra region.

The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have outlined another comprehensive economic stimulus package from the Federal Government. We will be carefully analysing these measures to inform our own economic stimulus response that will be required in the weeks ahead.

We cannot stress the seriousness of the situation our country, and our city, is now facing. Every decision we are making is painful, and it will impact on our local economy. We are doing this to try and save lives, but it’s only effective if all Canberrans make the necessary changes to help slow the spread of the virus. More onerous measures will be adopted in the weeks ahead, and they are likely to be in place throughout the pandemic.

Following similar announcements from the Premier of Victoria and the Premier of New South Wales, I will also be informing National Cabinet that the ACT will proceed to a more comprehensive shutdown of non-essential services over the next 48 hours. I expect all states and territories will do the same.

I believe this decision is in the best interest of Canberrans, and will help slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community. Despite measures in place to discourage social interaction, there are still too many instances where people are exposing themselves to contracting the virus which is leading to an unsustainable increase in confirmed cases across the country.

We must also face the reality that, as a Territory within NSW, it would be impossible for the ACT to have different arrangements than those in our surrounding region.

We will ensure that Canberrans continue to have access to the services they need – supermarkets, petrol stations, banks, pharmacies, post offices and convenience stores. Freight and logistics will also be considered as an essential service. Over the next 48 hours, we will define these essential services and work closely with retailers on their requirements.

As the ACT has maintained, we will be following the recommendations from National Cabinet on the operation of schools. We will be transitioning to an alternate distance education program for most students on Tuesday as well as continuing to provide a face to face education program for those students who need it.

I will be updating the community following National Cabinet this evening on next steps for the ACT.

ACT schools, government and non-government, will begin pupil-free days from Tuesday 24 March through to the school holidays despite statements from the Prime Minister.

This decision is consistent with the approach being adopted by NSW and Victoria.

Moving to pupil free days now will provide schools and teachers with time to prepare for a range of learning delivery options, including online, similar to how distance education is provided in remote areas.

The government is also making arrangements to allow vulnerable children to attend school in person. Further details of these arrangements will be provided tomorrow, Monday 23 March.

The ACT’s approach will continue to be informed by advice from the Chief Health Officer. For this reason, Lyneham High School will be closed on Monday 23 March to allow for enable the school and health officials to work through a contact and containment strategy after a COVID-19 case arising connected to the school.

Residential waste and recycling bin collections in the ACT will start from 5am as of Monday 23 March 2020.

Minister for Recycling and Waste Reduction, Chris Steel said the time change was put in place to provide safety for waste management staff at Suez and prevent driver shortages as a result of COVID-19.

The split shift implemented by Suez, with one shift starting earlier, and the other later, is helping to minimise the risk of transmission between staff interacting all at once before and after shifts.

“Suez is undertaking precautionary measures to minimise the health risks to staff and help to ensure that essential waste and recycling collection services continue,” Minister Steel said.

“We recommend that ACT households put their bins out the night before collection to ensure they can be picked up very early the next day.

“Whilst this may cause a slight shake up to people’s usual routines, it’s important that waste contractors have safeguards in place to ensure they can continue to deliver this service.

“I want to thank Suez staff involved for their work through this period, including working earlier than usual to deliver city services for Canberra.

“We’ve ensured that the new bin collection times have been approved by the ACT Environment Protection Authority regarding noise impacts.”

There are no changes to the start times of green bin collections, which will remain at 7am.

“The ACT’s waste and recycling drop-off facilities including the Container Deposit Scheme return points, resource management centres and recycling drop off centres are operating as normal,” Minister Steel said.

ACT NoWaste is continuing to work closely with the contracted service providers to monitor the situation and ensure plans are in place to manage impacts of COVID-19.

Today, Australian Education Ministers agreed that NAPLAN testing will not proceed in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

I welcome and support this sensible decision. This decision was made amid the challenges facing students, their families and teachers across the country.

Additionally, Education Ministers agreed it would be very difficult to undertake the NAPLAN tests and for the centralised marking centres to operate, as well as the higher than normal number of students expected to be unavailable to undertake the test.

Not proceeding with NAPLAN this year will be of great relief to the operation of schools in facilitating NAPLAN testing at this time -- importantly for teachers on the frontline every day..

Under the most challenging of circumstances, our teachers are showing up every day to continue educating our students. I am grateful for their commitment to students as always.

The decision not to proceed with NAPLAN in May also means the Coordinated Practice Test scheduled for next week will not go ahead.

The ACT Government is making testing for COVID-19 more accessible for Canberrans who meet the testing criteria, with the introduction of a drive through Respiratory Assessment Clinic. The clinic will be located at Exhibition Park in Canberra (EPIC) from Friday 20 March.

Minister for Health Rachel Stephen-Smith said the drive through clinic would complement the dedicated Respiratory Assessment Clinic already operating from the Weston Creek Walk-in Centre as well as the Canberra Hospital’s Respiratory Assessment Clinic.

“The Respiratory Assessment Clinic at the Weston Creek Walk-in Centre has been experiencing strong demand, so to assist with meeting this demand we will be providing Canberrans with the option for drive through COVID-19 testing at EPIC,” Minister Stephen-Smith said.

“We’re asking people presenting for a COVID-19 test to check prior to attending that they meet the meet the criteria for testing, just as we are with the Respiratory Assessment Clinic at the Weston Creek Walk-in Centre.

“You must also be driving or a passenger of a motor vehicle or motorbike. You will not be able to access the drive through testing service from public transport, or as a pedestrian.



“For northside residents who are not able to drive to EPIC, both the Belconnen and Gungahlin Walk-in Centres can undertake assessment and testing for COVID-19, but Weston Creek remains the recommended location,” Minister Stephen-Smith said.

You should get tested for COVID-19 if:

you’ve travelled overseas recently, and you develop symptoms of COVID-19 within 14 days of leaving an overseas country

you have been informed by your local Public Health Unit that you have come into contact with someone who has COVID-19 and you develop symptoms of the disease within 14 days of your last contact with that person

you’re a healthcare worker with direct patient contact, and have fever and acute respiratory symptoms, even if you have not recently travelled or had contact with someone who has COVID-19.

People presenting to the drive through Respiratory Assessment Clinic will first be screened to ensure they meet the criteria for testing before proceeding by vehicle into the Budawang Pavilion for testing. They will not be required to leave their vehicle.

Security and traffic operations will be on site to assist with traffic flow.

The drive-through Respiratory Assessment Clinic will operate seven days per week, from 9:30am to 6:00pm, and be staffed by experienced nursing and administrative staff from Canberra Health Services.

“The rate of testing for COVID-19 in Australia is high. I thank the hardworking and dedicated staff – in the Walk-in Centres, ACT Pathology and across primary healthcare services – who continue to provide exceptional health care for our community.”

The ACT’s public health services have tested more than 1800 people for COVID-19 since 10 February 2020 and in recent days have tested more than 200 people per day.

Following discussion and agreement at the National Cabinet today, and further unanimous support from the State and Territory Board of Treasurers, Governments around Australia are delaying their annual budgets until later in the financial year. Consistent with this national approach, the 2020/21 ACT Budget will be postponed.

Through the supply provisions contained within the Financial Management Act and future Appropriation Bills, the ACT Government will ensure we have the financial capacity to continue providing economic stimulus in response to the spread of COVID-19 across the country.

This decision will not impact on the ongoing delivery of Government services, or the Government’s ability to pay the salaries of our staff.

As the Prime Minister has noted, it is not possible to develop and set out fiscal and economic strategies for the full year. The economic impact of the National Cabinet’s response to the pandemic will continue to change, and Governments will need to act as quickly as possible.

How the nation responds to the COVID-19 pandemic will profoundly change the way of life we have come to expect. The decisions being made at the National Cabinet level are not easy. There are often no risk-free responses, and there are many competing priorities to balance.

Work will continue among State and Territory Governments, as well as the Commonwealth, on what measures are necessary to help businesses survive, support households and protect as many jobs as possible. This will be a priority in the ACT Government’s multi-staged economic response.

The spread of COVID-19 is having a profound impact on the way of life in the Territory and it will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.

The ACT Government has announced an economic survival package as the first phase in our plan to protect as many jobs as possible and support Canberra households and businesses.

The economic impacts of the virus will be felt for years. It will require a phased response both before, during and after the anticipated peak in COVID-19 cases across Australia.

In the first phase of our response, the ACT Government will implement a range of measures to reduce cashflow pressures in the short term for low income households and local small and medium businesses in the industry sectors that are most impacted.

Our priority in this first phase of economic support is to help our community through this incredibly difficult immediate period.

We must save as many local jobs as possible as our economy adjusts to the difficult decisions being made at the National level to flatten the transmission curve and support our healthcare system.

We will announce further packages as we transition through the different phases of this crisis.

The ACT’s stage one economic survival package, injecting $137 million into our local economy, includes rebates of $150 on residential rates to help ease cashflow pressures for Canberra households, as well as a freeze on a number of ACT Government fees and charges, including the fire and emergency services levy, public transport, vehicle registration and parking fees.

The Government will provide all appropriate resources to support ACT public health services to continue providing essential health services to the community and to respond to the additional demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes funding for respiratory assessment clinics, an increase in inpatient beds and ICU capacity across the Territory, maintenance of COVID-19 testing capacity and the purchase of additional medical equipment and supplies.

The health funding will also involve working with Winnunga Nimmityjah to enable the service to provide a respiratory assessment service for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Canberrans.

The package includes a number of measures to support small to medium businesses as they adjust to social distancing requirements and an expected downturn in our local economy. A rebate on the fixed charge for 2019-20 on commercial rates for properties with an AUV below $2 million will be provided, which particularly targets businesses who own their own premises.

For those businesses who lease premises, we have targeted other more direct assistance measures. For example, there will be a six month waiver on payroll tax for hospitality, creative arts and entertainment industries, the waiving of fees for food business registration and liquor licencing fees (excluding off-license) and outdoor dining fees and a $750 rebate for small business owners to help with power bills.

We will also provide access to interest free deferrals of payroll tax commencing 1 July 2020 for all businesses up to a payroll threshold of $10 million to significantly ease the cashflow pressures for medium sized businesses. Small businesses are already exempt from payroll tax thanks to the highest tax free threshold ($2m) in Australia. This initiative is anticipated to free up to an additional $100 million of businesses’ money when they need it most.

A business liaison team will assist local businesses with these measures.

We will provide an additional payment of $1.5 million, as well as freeing up the existing $1.8 million in the Clubs Diversification Fund, to support our clubs to keep staff employed on the clubs award rate. Immediate consultation will start directly with community clubs to investigate further ways the Government can help them keep as many Canberrans employed as possible as they re-adjust to social distancing requirements.

The Government has focused on how we can deliver targeted support for low-income households who are likely to be most impacted from any economic downturn. As a starting point, the ACT Government will provide rental support of $250 for all public housing tenants in the coming months, as well as a one-off rebate for residential utility concession holders of $200 to help with power bills. More work will be required in the coming months alongside any stimulus offered by the Commonwealth Government on income support.

Keeping Canberrans employed through infrastructure projects is another component of the ACT’s economic survival package, with $20 million to be immediately spent on infrastructure projects and maintenance on local schools, roads, and public transport.

The Government will provide more funding for the removal of dead trees, planting of new trees and maintenance of surrounding areas to redeploy existing government contractors impacted by event cancellations.

Additionally, there will be a new $500,000 round of grants funding for the arts sector.

Additional funding of $7 million for our non-government organisation partners to meet increased service demand for emergency relief will also be rolled out as part of our Community Support package.

We are re-prioritising funding to provide Lifeline ACT with an additional $100,000 to bolster services following a recent spike in calls , supporting the mental health of Canberrans who may be struggling.

ACT Government agencies have been instructed to prioritise the processing of development applications. Ten more staff have been added into the DA assessment team in addition to the ACT Government’s investment in new front line staff to process applications in the 2019-20 Budget. We now have the lowest number of active DAs since December 2016, and we want this trend to continue.

The ACT Government will also look to provide support by expediting the payment of bills to further provide cashflow support for small to medium businesses. The Government has committed to our own casual workforce through continued employment and appropriate access to COVID-19 leave where required.

This is a once in a century economic shock, and no level of Federal or ACT Government stimulus will be able to fully offset the impacts of this global crisis. National and Territory income will fall. Our stimulus efforts over the next 12-18 months will reduce the impact and support the eventual recovery, but the short term economic situation is grim.

The ACT Budget later this year and the 2020-21 Budget review will be further opportunities for the ACT Government to provide further phases of economic support. Additional measures will continue to be announced as the Government engages with various sectors over the coming weeks.

The ACT health system is putting in place new measures to help slow the spread of COVID‑19 in our community.

From today, Canberra’s public health services are introducing visitor restrictions at key sites, including Canberra Hospital, University of Canberra Hospital and Calvary Public Hospital.

Minister for Health Rachel Stephen-Smith said these changes will help to keep patients and staff safe.

“We’ve all heard the messages about social distancing and protecting those in our community who are most likely to become seriously ill with COVID‑19.

“Our top priority is reducing the potential spread of COVID-19 in the ACT. We need to ensure that those who are sick are not put at further risk. We also need to keep our health services staff safe and well so they can continue to provide healthcare to our community.

“Every single one of us has a role to play in this. If you are unwell, please do not visit our hospitals. We are also asking patients to limit visitors to one person per day.

“If you have an appointment at an outpatient clinic, please do not bring anyone unless absolutely necessary and if this is the case please limit it to one person.

“This is a difficult ask. We know that patients need the love and support of family and friends when undergoing treatment or in a hospital, and this policy will be applied with compassion and common sense. For example, children who are well will still be able to visit a parent or sibling accompanied by an adult.

“Decisions like this are not taken lightly. I hope all Canberrans can understand that this decision has been made to ensure the safety of staff and patients across our health system,” said Minister Stephen-Smith.

Dr Sanjaya Senanayake, CHS Senior Specialist Infectious Diseases said, “by restricting visitors to our hospital campus, we are trying to reduce the spread of COVID-19 amongst staff, patients, their friends and relatives, thereby protecting the people within our hospitals and in the wider community.”

The changes will be across all Canberra Health Services (CHS) campuses, including Canberra Hospital and University of Canberra Hospital (UCH) and Community Health Centres, as well as Calvary Public Hospital.

Private hospitals including National Capital Private Hospital are also introducing restrictions.

The services will be reviewing these changes in coming days with the view to implementing more restrictions should they be required to keep patients and staff safe.

«ACT Government Media Releases | «Minister Media Releases","Released 19/03/2020The ACT health system is putting in place new measures to help slow the spread of COVID‑19 in our community.
From today, Canberra’s public health services are introducing visitor restrictions at key sites, including Canberra Hospital, University of Canberra Hospital and Calvary Public Hospital.
Minister for Health Rachel Stephen-Smith said these changes will help to keep patients and staff safe.
“Our top priority is reducing the potential spread of COVID-19 in the ACT.

https://www.cmtedd.act.gov.au/open_government/inform/act_government_media_releases/yvette-berry-mla-media-releases/2020/flawed-data-released-under-myschool,Flawed data released under MySchool,2020-03-17 13:00:00+11,1584450000,"Released 18/03/2020

Today, the Australian Curriculum, Reporting and Assessment Authority (ACARA) released flawed NAPLAN data comparisons for the ACT on the MySchool website.

The data reported for the ACT do not present a reliable indicator of NAPLAN performance in the ACT. This is because of flaws in a new method for comparing the actual performance of a school with a statistical prediction of how the school should have performed in NAPLAN.

ACARA, other states and territories, and education data experts agree that there are anomalies in the ACT data.

With the support of all states and territories and the federal government, ACARA will seek expert advice to review the approach adopted for NAPLAN comparisons this year. Until this review is completed and the flaws corrected the comparisons cannot be relied on as a measure of the ACT's NAPLAN performance.

ACARA’s new method for benchmarking school NAPLAN results predicts the score that a student should have achieved in NAPLAN based on four factors. These factors are their parents’ job title and highest level of education, as well as the remoteness of their school and the percentage of Indigenous students at the school.

The average of predicted student scores for a school indicates the “expected” school performance, which is then compared with the actual average school score.

The method for predicting student scores does not work in the ACT.

The ACT has a predominately public service workforce where many people hold the job title ‘manager’ across a range of employment classifications. 65 per cent of ACT students have a parent with a bachelor’s degree or above, compared to the national average of 35 per cent.

These two factors together artificially increase predicted NAPLAN scores. Comparing the predicted and actual scores results in a large difference that falsely suggests underperformance of ACT schools, both government and non-government.

There is also a problem with establishing meaningful statistical prediction for the ACT because of the relatively small number of schools and students.

The change to how ACARA compares results between schools has meant that the data comparisons released today for ACT schools are even more unreliable and invalid than in previous years.

As I have consistently raised, NAPLAN is misused when schools are compared as though it is a competition. And there is more to measuring school performance than NAPLAN.

ACT schools, students and teachers continue to perform well. This is reinforced by the ACT bucking the national trend in the most recent OECD’s Programme for International School Assessment (PISA) test.

PISA tests 15-year-old students across the world conducted in 2018 and the results show that ACT students perform better on average than students across Australia, and better than most of the participating countries when it comes to mathematics, scientific literacy and reading literacy.

Specifically, the ACT ranked 3rd in reading (Australia ranked 17th), 4th in Science (Australia ranked 18th), and 11th in maths (Australia ranked 30th).

Additionally, the most recent ACT Post School Destinations and Pathways report, released last year, shows 93 per cent of young people who graduated in 2017 were employed or undertaking further study in 2018 -- 6 per cent higher than the national average. Further, 97 per cent of 2015 year 12 graduates reported that they were employed or studying in 2018.

The life outcomes of a student is the whole point of school and the education system.

NAPLAN is a narrow point in time assessment that provides limited information about only a few aspects among all the learning happening in schools.

The aggregate result of the 2019 NAPLAN tests show that the ACT continues to perform well achieving top or equal top by mean score in 18 of 20 areas tested in NAPLAN 2019.

The ACT Government aims to give every child and young person a great education and, in turn, the positive life experiences that flow from that. Our school leaders, teachers and support staff work every day to equip our students for success.

Transport Canberra has this week ramped up its on-vehicle and interchange cleaning regime, with a program of twice daily bus and light rail cleaning, and daily cleaning of stations, as the ACT Government responds to COVID-19.

“Public transport is an essential service for the Canberra community, and we are working hard to ensure these services continue to be provided by Transport Canberra and Canberra Metro, while minimising risk for our customers and drivers,"" Minister for Transport Chris Steel said.

“From this week, Transport Canberra is implementing an increased cleaning regime on our buses and light rail. Teams are stepping up the cleaning of hard surfaces such as seats across bus stations and light rail interchanges.

“The ACT Government has engaged Robson Environmental to undertake a study to make any further recommendations on Transport Canberra’s cleaning practices.

“We are reminding our customers and our drivers to practice good hygiene on and around public transport and we are asking Canberrans to avoid using public transport if they feel unwell.

“People can help us reduce the need to handle cash by using MyWay cards, and tickets can be purchased from ticket vending machines located at major bus stations and all light rail stops. Purchasing a MyWay card is also a cheaper option.”

Minister Steel said that the ACT and other jurisdictions had started to see a significant drop in the number of people using public transport in recent weeks. However, customers are still being asked to take measures to help reduce crowding.

“To prevent crowding, we are asking people to consider adjusting their travel times by travelling earlier or later than their normal commute. This will mean less people on our buses and light rail at any one time.

“As of today, Transport Canberra bus drivers are being advised to allow passengers to enter and exit buses via the rear door to reduce interactions between other passengers and drivers,” Minister Steel said.

The ACT Minister for Health Rachel Stephen-Smith has declared a Public Health Emergency in response to the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation across Australia.

A declaration of a Public Health Emergency allows the Chief Health Officer to take any action, or give any direction, considered to be necessary to protect Canberrans and reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the ACT.

This is the first time a Public Health Emergency has been declared in the ACT. It is one of the best signals we can provide to the community to help reduce the spread of COVID-19.

While there are only two confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the ACT, this decision has been made now to ensure consistency across all states and territories and to enable our Chief Health Offer to take required actions to keep Canberrans safe.

Following the Commonwealth Government’s announcement yesterday that all people arriving in Australia are required to self-isolate for 14 days, we are asking the Canberrans to take this instruction seriously.

This is a measure that has been put in place to slow down the spread of this rapidly evolving disease.

The National Cabinet, which met on Friday and again yesterday, also endorsed the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) to further introduce social distancing measures. This includes the requirement that non-essential, organised public gatherings of more than 500 people should not occur.

At this early stage, there is no requirement for schools to close. This is based on health advice and is consistent with other states and territories. To ensure our schools remain as safe as possible the ACT Government recommends that schools:

Suspend sports carnivals and large concerts

Consider postponing school fetes and other events

Begin postponing excursions from today, with excursions planned for early in the week considered case by case

Public schools are also planning for digital delivery of lessons, if it becomes required, using the ACT’s nation leading investment in technology enabled learning and chrome books.

ACT Health and ACT Education will continue to work together to ensure decisions made are based on the most up to date health advice available.

We are asking for the community’s support to ensure these measures are followed and that we are all doing the right thing to protect one another.

The ACT Cabinet met this morning to further discuss the Government’s response to COVID-19, including any service changes as a result of the declaration of a Public Health Emergency in the ACT.

Decisions will be made by the ACT Government in a calm and sensible manner, guided by the expert advice of health professionals. The national response to this public health emergency is not an easy process. What we are seeking is a balance between slowing the spread to so we can treat those that will need critical health support, and a complete destruction of our economy.

Each decision we will make in the coming months will be difficult, and it will have consequences on the way of life we have come to expect. The decisions we make in response to COVID-19 must be done knowing that we will be managing this for a significant period of time.

Ensuring we effectively respond to the risk posed by a rapid spread of COVID-19 is our top priority. We will continue to work with the state and territories, support and resource our health services and respond appropriately to protect our community.

The investigation arose after Queensland police located the fingerprints of the man on the seizure of 30kg of cannabis from a car in Willowbank, Queensland on 17 February 2020.

This resulted in search warrants being executed today in four suburbs and four cannabis grow houses being discovered. Within each of these homes, sophisticated and extensive hydroponic setups were in place to support the cultivation of the commercial crops.

The investigation has been conducted with the assistance of Queensland Police and the Australian Border Force.

Police seized 51 cannabis seedlings and 230 established plants of varied sizes. More than $90,000 worth of dried cannabis in single pound bags was seized.

During this investigation, police confirmed that fake identification was used to obtain tenancy agreements at each of the homes. There is no evidence that any of the home owners were aware their properties were being used for commercial cannabis production and these home owners will be many thousands of dollars out of pocket as a result of the damage and contamination of their properties.

Police encourage anyone who is renting a property - especially property managers - to confirm the validity of documents they are provided via ID Match and view the fake identification documents released today by ACT Policing.

ACT Policing has provided advice to our members to maximise hygiene controls to continue to conduct roadside alcohol and drug testing safely.

In the past few years, rather than a large-scale static approach to roadside testing, every ACT Policing member conducts random breath testing and we work hard to ensure we have the right people, in the right place, at the right time.

The public should continue to expect that roadside alcohol or drug testing can happen anywhere, any time on any road by police in marked and unmarked police vehicles.

Reducing road trauma remains a whole of community approach. Road safety is everyone’s responsibility - if you are drinking, ensure you have a designated driver or find another way home.

ACT Policing will continue to act on the most current health advice and review our practices for the safety of our members and community.

Case Title: R v Stott (No 2) Citation: [2020] ACTSC 62 Hearing Date: 19 March 2020, 23 March 2020 Decision Date: 23 March 2020 Before: Elkaim J Decision: The application for bail is granted Catchwords: CRIMINAL LAW – JURISDICTION, PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE – Bail Application – s 20C Bail Act 2002 (ACT) – change of circumstances – adherence to stringent conditions – outbreak of infectious disease Legislation Cited: Bail Act 1992 (ACT) s 20C Parties: Sharon Stott (Applicant) The Queen (Respondent) Representation: Counsel S Whybrow (Applicant) A Williamson (Respondent) Solicitors Kamy Saeedi Law (Applicant) ACT Director of Public Prosecutions (Respondent) File Numbers: SCC 90 of 2019 Publication restriction: The publication of these reasons is restricted to those reasons set out from [1] – [14] inclusive. The whole of the reasons will be published after the trial of the applicant.

ELKAIM J:

1. This is an application for bail made pursuant to s 20C of the Bail Act 1992 (ACT). In order to succeed the applicant must show that there has been a change of circumstances since her last application, which was made on 31 January 2020.

2. The change of circumstances asserted here is the impact of the coronavirus, in particular COVID-19.

3. The applicant says that the virus primarily impacts upon her in two ways: Firstly, whilst in prison, she is more susceptible to contracting the virus, and, secondly, the limited social activity which she is able to carry on in the prison has been curtailed.

4. As a secondary concern the applicant says that the interference to the court processes that have been, and no doubt will be, a result of the pandemic will cause her trial to be delayed so that she will remain in custody for a longer period before trial.

5. The latter point can be dealt with shortly: The applicant has elected for a judge alone trial which has been given a hearing date of 25 May 2020. Unlike jury trials, there is no reason yet, to anticipate that her trial will not proceed.

6. As a general statement, there can be no doubt that COVID-19 has brought about a massive change of circumstances to society and in particular the way society goes about its ordinary daily life.

7. The question here however is whether or not the change of circumstances personally impacts upon the applicant. This raises two questions:

(a) Is the applicant more likely to contract the virus in custody, than in the open community?

(b) What is the effect of the virus on the limited social activities available to the applicant whilst in custody?

8. The matter originally came before me last week when the Crown sought some time to investigate the likelihood of the virus being more easily contracted in the AMC. The Crown did not, today, provide any further information on this topic. However, the Crown pointed out that the onus in this application is on the applicant and it is for her to demonstrate a heightened susceptibility.

9. The applicant tendered two documents in support of her case. The first is a notice issued to visitors of inmates currently residing at the AMC telling them that as of 22 March 2020 no further visits to inmates will be permitted. The notice is relevant to both of the questions posed in [7], above. Firstly, it states that the purpose of the action is to limit “the risk of infection to detainees, visitors and staff”. Clearly the Commissioner of ACT Corrective Services is concerned, in the overcrowded circumstances currently existing at the AMC, that staff and inmates will be at serious risk of contagion if the virus finds its way into the facility.

10. Secondly, the ban on visitors has a direct consequence on the social contact previously allowed to inmates. I was informed, without objection, that the applicant has been frequently visited by her children.

11. The second document is an open letter to the assorted Australian governments from, as a general description, legal academics and lawyers, calling on the governments to take urgent steps to address issues of the virus in prisons.

12. Returning again to the above questions, I do not think the evidence presently available enables me to say that a person in custody at the AMC is more likely to contract the virus than if that person was living in the community. The applicant’s counsel referred to the AMC as a cruise ship, no doubt because of events that have taken place on cruise ships around the world. Other than the presence of a number of people in a confined space, I can see no other similarity between the AMC and a cruise ship.

13. As far as the second question is concerned, I think the curtailment of visiting rights is a relevant factor and, personal to the applicant, does amount to a change of circumstances. Persons on remand no doubt rely on the limited social contact they are permitted, most of which is achieved through visits. In particular, contact with family is an important element in the life of a person resident at the AMC.

14. The change of circumstances which I have found, enables me to proceed with the bail application. The Crown opposes bail and has raised a number of significant factors in support of its position. Less there be any doubt the only relevance in this matter of the COVID-19 outbreak is to whether or not there has been a change of circumstances. The balance of the bail application does not take into account the outbreak.

COURT OF APPEAL

COSTS – APPLICATION FOR COSTS – Appellant seeks that his costs of the hearing and the appeal be paid by the respondent – whether appropriate to make costs order in favour of the appellant where he had success on some issues but the appeal was ultimately dismissed – need for some good reason to be shown for the court to deprive a successful party of costs – no such reason – appellant to pay the respondent’s costs of the appeal and the cross-appeal

THE COURT:

The discretion is broad but is to be exercised judicially. The fundamental purpose of the discretion is to compensate the successful party, not to punish the unsuccessful party. The furtherance of the goal of compensation means that, in general, a successful party will obtain an order for costs in its favour (Oshlack v Richmond River Council (1998) 193 CLR 72; [1998] HCA 11 at [65]-[68]). However, “a successful party who has failed on certain issues may not only be deprived of the costs of those issues but may be ordered as well to pay the other party’s costs of them...” (Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association (Inc) [1986] FCA 382; (1986) ATPR 40-748 at 48,136). If apportionment of costs is appropriate, the object is not mathematical precision (Dodds Family Investments Pty Ltd (formerly Solar Tint Pty Ltd) v Lane Industries Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 259; (1993) 26 IPR 261 at 272) but a result that best reflects the interests of justice in the overall circumstances of the case.

The rationale of the order is that it is just and reasonable that the party who has caused the other party to incur the costs of litigation should reimburse that party for the liability incurred. The order is not made to punish the unsuccessful party. Its function is compensatory. Thus, in civil proceedings an order may, and usually will, be made even though the unsuccessful party has nearly succeeded or has acted reasonably in commencing the proceedings. It may, and usually will, be made even though the action has failed through no fault of the unsuccessful party.

[85] From these decisions, I would distil the following principles. The discretion to order costs is a wide, unconfined discretion. It must be exercised judicially but is not confined by absolute rules such as that in the absence of disentitling conduct, a successful party is to be (partially) compensated by the unsuccessful party. Similarly, there is no absolute rule that the sole purpose of a costs order is to compensate one party at the expense of another.

[86] Nevertheless, ordinarily, the party who has created the litigation and failed in it will be required to meet the costs of the other party. Further, where there has been some delinquency on the part of a party, even the successful party, that may justify depriving that party of their costs or even requiring them to pay the other party’s costs.

[87] There will also be other reasons that are relevant to the decision as to which party should bear the costs of the other party. The range of such reasons should not be limited and will include the nature of the litigation (such as in Oshlack v Richmond River Council) the conduct of a party (Foots v Southern Cross Mine Management Pty Limited & Ors) or the involvement of a non-party (Knight & Anor v F P Special Assets Limited (1992) 174 CLR 178). See also Probiotec Ltd and Ors v University of Melbourne and Ors (2008) 166 FCR 30 at 42-4.","The fundamental purpose of the discretion is to compensate the successful party, not to punish the unsuccessful party.

These rely on the ability to store and manipulate large data structures efficiently and to perform a large number of basic arithmetic operations, typically floating point. Central to this success has been a synergistic advancement of quantum chemistry methods and the underlying computer systems that they use.
 
At the dawn of the exascale computational era, as high-performance computational hardware morphs into throughput-oriented massively parallel architectures, quantum chemical methods and their underpinning algorithms and implementations must evolve accordingly. In this lecture, I will discuss the development of hardware-synergistic algorithms and software designed for running on the world’s most powerful supercomputers to tackle one of the grand challenges of our century: to predict the chemistry of large molecular systems.

She was an undergraduate at the University of Sydney from 1965-1968, completing a B.Sc. with First Class Honours, and completed her PhD at the Australian National University (ANU) under the supervision of P.A.P. (Pat) Moran. The title of her dissertation, for which she was awarded the 1975 Peter William Stroud Prize by the ANU, was Some Statistical Results in Genetics (1972).

Sue took up a lectureship in the Department of Probability and Statistics at the University of Sheffield in 1972 but returned to ANU in 1974 when she took up a position as Research Fellow in Pat Moran’s Department of Statistics in the ANU Institute of Advanced Studies. She became a Fellow in 1976 and a Senior Fellow in 1984. Between 1988 and 1996, Sue held various appointments jointly with the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health (NCEPH) at ANU and the Statistics Research Section in the School of Mathematical Sciences at ANU. This latter group became the Statistical Science Program in the Centre for Mathematics and its Applications (CMA) which Sue joined in 1991. She was promoted to Professor in 1994. She was co-founder and Director of the Centre for Bioinformation Science, which was set up as a joint research centre between the School of Mathematical Sciences and the John Curtin School of Medical Research in 2001. Sue became a Professor Emeritus of Bioinformation Science and Statistical Science at ANU and an Honorary Professor in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of New South Wales in 2008.

Sue was an elected member of the International Statistical Institute (ISI, 1979), elected Fellow of the American Statistical Association (ASA, 1991) and elected Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS, 1995). She was the Editor of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics Bulletin from 1993-1997 and President of the International Biometric Society (IBS, 1998-1999). During her tenure, the IBS established the Sub-Saharan Network (SUSAN). Sue was awarded the inaugural E. A. (Alf) Cornish Award by the Australasian Region of the International Biometric Society for her contributions to Biometrics (2011), and Honorary Life Membership of IBS ‘for outstanding contributions to the development and promotion of the discipline of Biometry’ in 2012. Sue was made an inaugural Senior Fellow of the Australian Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Society (2017).

Sue’s early research interests were in statistical genetics and from there spread into biostatistics, population health and bioinformatics. She had important research collaborations with J.G. Oakeshott (measuring selection on Drosophila populations), A. Thorne (physical anthropology), G.K. Ward (radiocarbon dating), J. Cavanaugh (mapping human disease susceptibility genes), P.J. Solomon (modelling and predicting the spread of AIDS in Australia) and C.J. Burden (Bioinformatics). Her later interest in bioinformatics was driven by a passion for developing rigorous statistical techniques for analysing and interpreting the large-scale genomic data that has become the basis of modern biology. She published over 200 refereed publications in applied statistics and bioinformatics. Many of these papers were motivated by substantive research questions she met when consulting in the biological and medical sciences. Sue was the Section Editor for Computation for the Encyclopedia of Biostatistics (Wiley, 1995-2004), and Editor for the theme Biometrics in the Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems (UNESCO, 2000-2007).

For much of her career, Sue held research appointments. She was however always cognisant of the importance of educating younger researchers and passing on knowledge. Before the teaching of bioinformatics had become established in Australia, Sue was instrumental in setting up the annual BioInfoSummer Summer Symposia in Bioinformatics in 2003. BioInfoSummer is now established as Australia's major annual educational meeting for graduate students and early career researchers in bioinformatics. Sue was particularly kind and supportive of early career researchers, still proofreading and assisting to the end with Discovery Early Career Research Award (DECRA) applications. Indicative of her generosity towards young researchers was her endowment of a scholarship for honours students in mathematical biology in memory of her close friend and colleague Hilary Booth, and travel awards to enable undergraduate students to attend conferences in statistical science.

Sue is survived by her son Jonathan.

For much of her career, Sue held research appointments. She was however always cognisant of the importance of educating younger researchers and passing on knowledge. Before the teaching of bioinformatics had become established in Australia, Sue was instrumental in setting up the annual BioInfoSummer Summer Symposia in Bioinformatics in 2003. BioInfoSummer is now established as Australia's major annual educational meeting for graduate students and early career researchers in bioinformatics. Sue was particularly kind and supportive of early career researchers, still proofreading and assisting to the end with Discovery Early Career Research Award (DECRA) applications. Indicative of her generosity towards young researchers was her endowment of a scholarship for honours students in mathematical biology in memory of her close friend and colleague Hilary Booth, and travel awards to enable undergraduate students to attend conferences in statistical science.

Sue is survived by her son Jonathan.

(Pat) Moran.  The title of her dissertation, for which she was awarded the 1975 Peter William Stroud Prize by the ANU, was Some Statistical Results in Genetics (1972).
Sue took up a lectureship in the Department of Probability and Statistics at the University of Sheffield in 1972 but returned to ANU in 1974 when she took up a position as Research Fellow in Pat Moran’s Department of Statistics in the ANU Institute of Advanced Studies.  She became a Fellow in 1976 and a Senior Fellow in 1984.  Between 1988 and 1996, Sue held various appointments jointly with the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health (NCEPH) at ANU and the Statistics Research Section in the School of Mathematical Sciences at ANU. This latter group became the Statistical Science Program in the Centre for Mathematics and its Applications (CMA) which Sue joined in 1991.  She was promoted to Professor in 1994.  She was co-founder and Director of the Centre for Bioinformation Science, which was set up as a joint research centre between the School of Mathematical Sciences and the John Curtin School of Medical Research in 2001.  Sue became a Professor Emeritus of Bioinformation Science and Statistical Science at ANU and an Honorary Professor in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of New South Wales in 2008.
Sue was an elected member of the International Statistical Institute (ISI, 1979), elected Fellow of the American Statistical Association (ASA, 1991) and elected Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS, 1995).  She was the Editor of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics Bulletin from 1993-1997 and President of the International Biometric Society (IBS, 1998-1999).  During her tenure, the IBS established the Sub-Saharan Network (SUSAN).  Sue was awarded the inaugural E. A. (Alf) Cornish Award by the Australasian Region of the International Biometric Society for her contributions to Biometrics (2011), and Honorary Life Membership of IBS ‘for outstanding contributions to the development and promotion of the discipline of Biometry’ in 2012.  Sue was made an inaugural Senior Fellow of the Australian Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Society (2017).
Sue’s early research interests were in statistical genetics and from there spread into biostatistics, population health and bioinformatics.  She had important research collaborations with J.G. Oakeshott (measuring selection on Drosophila populations), A. Thorne (physical anthropology), G.K. Ward (radiocarbon dating), J. Cavanaugh (mapping human disease susceptibility genes), P.J. Solomon (modelling and predicting the spread of AIDS in Australia) and C.J. Burden (Bioinformatics).  Her later interest in bioinformatics was driven by a passion for developing rigorous statistical techniques for analysing and interpreting the large-scale genomic data that has become the basis of modern biology.  She published over 200 refereed publications in applied statistics and bioinformatics. Many of these papers were motivated by substantive research questions she met when consulting in the biological and medical sciences. Sue was the Section Editor for Computation for the Encyclopedia of Biostatistics (Wiley, 1995-2004), and Editor for the theme Biometrics in the Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems (UNESCO, 2000-2007).

ANU has announced plans to pause all coursework and teaching for one week from 23 March. The ANUSA offices and BKSS will be closed next week and all staff will be working from home. Services will still be delivered remotely to students. If you need assistance please contact us by email and we will endeavour to respond as soon as we can.

There is no immediate threat to our campus or community due to Covid-19 (Coronavirus), but the situation is resulting in changes to how ANUSA operates. Below we have outlined these changes. If we make any more adjustments we will update you on our website and social media.



Student Assistance & Legal

All Student Assistance and Legal appointments will now be carried out either online or by phone.

If you would like to make an appointment please contact sa.admin@anu.edu.au



Migration Workshops will be moved online. Register online as usual and our admin team will contact you closer to the time with a link to the workshop.

Grocery and meal vouchers will now be sent in the form of digital vouchers. Email sa.admin@anu.edu.au for details.



BKSS

The Brian Kenyon Student Space will be closed from Monday 23rd March to Friday 27th March in line with the University’s ‘pause’ of the teaching period. We expect to re-open BKSS on Monday 30th March but will update you on our website and social media channels if this changes. Unfortunately, we have had to cancel Universal Lunch Hour and Student Bites for the rest of semester 1. Venue hire and equipment hire has also been suspended. Whilst formal social events are cancelled, once BKSS re-opens you will be welcome to join us in the BKSS to study, hang out with friends, or grab our free breakfast.



Clubs

ANU has taken the precautionary measure of cancelling all nonessential events on campus. Any events on campus run by clubs between now and the 20th June will not be able to go ahead. If you have an off campus event planned we would encourage you to postpone or cancel this event, in line with the advice to minimise nonessential contact. If you have any concerns please contact sa.clubs@anu.edu.au



Events and Training

All ANUSA events are either being moved online, postponed, or cancelled on a case-by-case basis.

Course Rep Training will also be carried out online. If you are a 2020 course rep please contact sa.admin@anu.edu.au for more information.

All future meetings (Student Representative Councils, College Representative Councils and General Meetings) will be moved online to the platform Zoom. All members of ANUSA will still be able to participate in these meetings. All ANU students can create a Zoom account using the ANU corporate licence (https://services.anu.edu.au/information-technology/software-systems/anu-zoom-client).

If you have any questions, please email the General Secretary Taylor Heslington at sa.gensec@anu.edu.au

Advocacy

The ANUSA President sits on the ANU Crisis Management Team’s Community Wellbeing Group and our Vice-President is on the Teaching Continuity group. If you have any questions or comments you would like to be put to either of these committees, please contact sa.president@anu.edu.au or sa.vicepres@anu.edu.au



If you have concerns about changes to your course we encourage you to reach out to your College Representatives.

As we see an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases around Australia and here in the ACT, we would like to share with you the steps that we are taking at Ainslie and Gorman Arts Centres to continue to provide a safe working environment for all staff, residents and patrons.

While we enjoy hosting a variety of events, the safety of our Centres’ users is paramount. In order to mitigate the risk posed to our community we have made the decision cancel our public and social community events, introduced hygiene checkpoints across both centres and have encouraged staff to work from home.

Although things may not be business as usual, we would like to encourage our community to stay calm, keep safe and continue to be mindful of others. If you have cold or flu-like symptoms please stay home, our diverse community does include higher risk demographics so we ask that you help them stay safe and well.

Photo Access is working on creating an online version of the exhibition but it will take a little while for them to get it up and running.Reviewed by Brian RopeLoud &amp; Luminous is an annual celebration of Australian women photographers. It includes a symposium, this exhibition, the launch of the Loud &amp; Luminous book for 2020 and artist talks.Re-Generations, curated byCanberra’s Hilary Wardhaugh, features five contemporary female artist photographers. It is about experiences of personal growth and change. It exposes inherited trauma, family relationships and the stories to be learned from inter-generational memories. It reveals some subtle shades of meaning relating to the possibilities of female lives today.Addressing issues relating to women’s opportunities for personal growth and to the traumas associated with domestic violence through quality photographic art adds greatly to the messages to which we all must respond. Like many women before them, these photographers have recognised a deep responsibility to influence the conversation and make impact. All of us, but particularly men, must take note.Helga Salwe tells us that time spent in the mountains and deserts of Morocco during a period of radical change in her personal life allowed her painful feelings to emerge and heal. We are blessed to be able to view her fine monochrome prints and reflect on how we might have felt in the same place with similar feelings. Her image Sandstormparticularly speaks to me, telling about a person’s life in this desert place. Equally, Home of the Earth is remarkable for how the depicted home seemingly merges into the earth around it.Helga Salwe, Sandstorm, 2019, archival pigment ink on portfolio rag, 30x 42cmTamara Whyte, an indigenous artist from far North Queensland, has contributed three short documentary video works, extending her photographic and video practice. They focus on the survival of Aboriginal people; their resilience and resistance whilst adapting to change. Buffalo Horns with its insistent but gentle tap, tap, tap sound is at once both mesmerising and educational.Tamara Whyte, Bonescape, 2020, single channel digital video, 16.5 secondsSuellen Cook describes herself as “a photographer of the imagination” who likes “to tell stories through images that mysteriously bubble into my consciousness”. Her stunning conceptual images shown here reveal emotions she has experienced during her life journey, when adversity or life-changing events have initially knocked her down. Reading the words accompanying each print we can follow how Cook responded, rose from the ashes and made her choices to become more resilient and stronger. Whilst the set of powerful prints together tells a fuller story, each large print successfully stands on its own.Suellen Cook, THE PHOENIX, 2020, photographic inkjet print, 75 x 75cmElise Searson, who works as a photojournalist in Batemans Bay, also draws on her personal narrative, sharing with us some of her own intense experience of motherhood. In the exhibition catalogue, she tells us that becoming a mother makes one imagine their past and, especially, how we all begin life; and that it can trigger questions because of generational trauma. The words written directly on the gallery wall to accompany her image After Innocence made me smile as well as think.Elise Searson, Mother One, 2020, multimedia digital scan and inkjet print, 61cm x 91cmTricia King’s contribution explores the importance of memories as a place where identity and meaning can be rediscovered and shared. Each piece is a pair of closely associated portraits of an older woman living in aged care facilities, with the two images used to offset one another. On the left of each is an early portrait of the woman, on the right a new portrait. Having myself created a memory book of words and family images when my mother went into aged care, these works reminded me again how photographs enable an older person to share memories with others, particularly younger family. King’s juxtapositions of the now and then in these women’s lives are fabulous. The story of Margerie is especially well portrayed.Tricia King, The Photographs of Home; Margerie, 2019,photographic inkjet print, 80 x 40cmThis excellent exhibition is a credit to all involved.This review was also published in the Canberra Times and in Brian Rope Photography's blog at&nbsp;https://brianropephotography.wordpress.com/, both on&nbsp;&nbsp;on 25 March 2020.",['noreply@blogger.com (Canberra Critics Circle)']

The storyline for Verdi’s ninth opera focuses on the character of Odabella (Natalie Oroyan), who as a child, witnessed her father being slain by Attila (Taras Berezhansky). When the opera commences she’s an adult, captured by Attila’s army when it overruns her city.&nbsp; Impressed by her defiance of his soldiers, Attila courts Odabella presenting her with his dagger, which she secretly vows to use to kill him in vengeance for her father and her lover, Foresto (Diego Torre) whom she believes to be dead.However, being opera, Foresto returns, accuses Odabella of unfaithfulness, and despite her protests that she only stays with Attila for the opportunity to kill him, also hatches his own plot to murder Attila who has managed to earn the wrath of Roman General Ezio (Simone Piazzola) by rejecting Ezio’s&nbsp; proposal to divide the empire.Taras Berezhansky (Attila) - Natalie Aroyan (Odabella)&nbsp;But despite this interesting quartet of characters and their compact story, Verdi was more concerned with using the opera as a demonstration of Italian patriotism, which was very much to the fore at the time the opera was written. “Attila” calls for huge resources, both visual and vocal, to do justice to Verdi’s grand vision, with its succession of glorious arias and massive choruses. Director Davide Livermore has a flair for spectacle, and with this co- production, shared with Teatro alla Scala, he doesn’t stint. Setting the production in the war-ravished Italy of the 1940’s he’s shoe-horned massive set pieces of bombed bridges and ballrooms, even a couple of live horses, on to stage of the Joan Sutherland theatre, augmented with spectacular digital images. Natalie Aroyan (Odabella) in Opera Australia's production of ""Attila"".&nbsp;His use of LED screens in this production is more subtle than in his controversial production of “Aida”, in this instance, complimenting rather than dominating. However his propensity for repetition, particularly with the filmed sequence of the murder of Odabella’s father’s, tended to irritate more than enlighten. Reflecting the period when the opera was written, he’s incorporated a series of spectacular tableau, complimented by freeze-frame sequences, particularly effective in the harrowing opening scenes when prisoners are lined up and shot.Making her role debut in this production, Natalie Oroyan, as Odabella, was nothing less than magnificent. Her confident bearing, compelling acting, and creamy smooth soprano which effortlessly conquered the vocal complexities of demanding&nbsp; acrobatic runs &nbsp;through the full soprano range, and particularly impressive&nbsp; when soaring above the massive choruses, her performance in this role confirms her as a singer of International stature and a jewel among Opera Australia’s current roster.Diego Torre (Forresto) - Natalie Aroyan (Odabella)&nbsp;No less impressive was Diego Torre, also making his role debut as Foresto. His ravishing tenor and passionate acting elevated an otherwise pedestrian tenor role into a highlight.The sonorous voices of bass, Taras Berezhansky (Attila) and baritone, Simone Piazzola (Ezio), &nbsp;also provided a memorable highlight early in the opera with their duet “You may have the universe, but let Italy remain mine”, while Virgilio Marino as Attila’s &nbsp;confidante, Uldino,&nbsp; and Gennadi Dubinsky as Pope Leo 1, provided additional lustre to the line-up of particularly fine &nbsp;male voices.Taras Berezhansky (Attila) - Natalie Aroyan (Odabella) - Diego Torre (Forresto)on Opera Australia's production of ""Attila""Combined with the pleasure of thrilling sound produced by the massive ensemble and orchestra confidently conducted by Verdi specialist, Andrea Licata, this stunning production of “Attila” was a night of grand opera that few who experienced it is likely to forget. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Images by Prudence UptonThis review also published in Australian Arts Review. www.artsreview.com.au",['noreply@blogger.com (Canberra Critics Circle)']

For me, these words come reasonably close “A portrait is an artwork that has been created about a person or persons which tells us something about them.” That doesn’t mean a portrait has to look like or clearly show the person’s face. For me, revealing information about the person is the key element.48 entries were shortlisted for 2020. There are two works that are collaborations between two artists. Two artists each achieved two shortlisted works. And five of the works are by Canberrans:Oxygen Thief,&nbsp;by Lori Ciccini, stands out for two reasons. It is framed differently to the other works (artistically) and is not about a named person but portrays “the contemporary human”. Arguably, it tells us more about the photographer herself. Nevertheless, it is an extraordinary, created image that made this viewer think.Oxygen Thief&nbsp;© Lori CicciniMike Bowers is&nbsp;Photographer-at-Large for Guardian Australia and also host of Talking Pictures on ABC TV. His image,&nbsp;Prime&nbsp;Minister, taken during a parliamentary vote, shows the PM sitting alone and looking uncertain, whilst other MPs stand in the background.Prime Minister&nbsp;© Mike BowersBrothers, by Steven Lloyd, was captured when two brothers re-united at a family gathering. Lloyd has succeeded in showing the joyous emotions of the occasion, as well as revealing the physical likenesses shared by Nik and Rouli.Brothers&nbsp;© Steven LloydBrenda L Croft presents us with&nbsp;Matilda, a strong portrait of Canberran and Ngambri/ Ngunnawal Elder, Aunty Matilda House.

With Aboriginal heritage herself, Cumpston has said it was refreshing to see so many images of and by Aboriginal people among this year’s finalists. “Importantly, the NPPP is a democratic view of our society at this particular time in history, and the final exhibition tours nationally, which is a great gift for the nation.” Perhaps that is a partial answer to Laslett’s question.There are other images of great interest for a variety of reasons, such as their storytelling, dramatic effects, background choices, and great subjects.

Accompanist Mark Ferguson. The Spiegel Zelt. Garden of Unearthly Delights. Adelaide Fringe . February 15 – March 15 2020Reviewed by Peter WilkinsIt’s 1971 and Ol’ Blue Eyes is wowing the crowd in the Purple Room in Palm Springs. Bill Miller accompanies the old favourites on the piano. This is the self-confessed saloon singer’s favourite spot and he croons the popular melodies with the svelte Sinatra sound. At the bar, Tony Curreri keeps the Jack Daniels coming.Richard Shelton as Frank Sinatra in Raw SinatraFlash forward to 2020 and living personification of Sinatra, Richard Shelton wows a Fringe audience in the Spiegel Zelt at the Garden of Unearthly Delights. The night is growing chilly outside but inside Shelton’s appeal and friendly rapport soon warms&nbsp; the hearts of the Sinatra fans. Shelton is Sinatra and Raw Sinatra is his tribute to a legendary entertainer for whom he obviously has enormous love and respect. His arrangements of such favourites as A Very Good Year, I’ve Got You Under My Skin, That’s Life and My Way reincarnate Sinatra’s seductive charm. The renditions glide and soar through the Spiegel Zelt, gathering momentum and power to the stirring rendition of &nbsp;That’s Life and carrying the transfixed audience back to the intimate atmosphere of the Purple Room all those years ago. To watch the singer is to remember Sinatra in his mature years, self-possessed, assured, confident and in control, quick with a quip and fiery if fools should cross his path. Shelton’s one hour cabaret show is all of this and more. He is Sinatra here and now and every song opens the memory to a man who lit up the world of entertainment.Raw Sinatra is not simply a song recital, a trip down memory lane through Sinatra’s popular repertoire. &nbsp;&nbsp;Shelton intertwines the songs with anecdotes and accounts of Sinatra’s colourful and sometimes turbulent life from his first professional role in 1936 to his Purple Room concert of 1971. Shelton introduces himself as Sinatra at the same age and accomplished jazz pianist Mark Ferguson as his 1971 accompanist Bill Miller. The audience is in for a fascinating, entertaining and alluring biogig, and though some may have seemed surprised, none was disappointed. Shelton held them in his thrall.&nbsp;Right from the start, Shelton made his audience feel as if at home in&nbsp;Sinatra's beloved&nbsp;Purple Room. He welcomes Gina Lollobrigida and Carey Grant in the front row and launches into the rousing All or Nothing At All, Sinatra’s first 1939 recording with the Harry James Orchestra. &nbsp;That’s all it took for the audience to be quietly humming away. Shelton is the seductive medium and Sinatra his spirit Muse.The numbers keep coming as do the sips from the constantly filled glass of Jack Daniels&nbsp; . The songs are accompanied by anecdotes of his escapades with the notorious Rat Pack, his battles with movie mogul Louis B Mayer, his fury at rumours of his association with the Mafia and most of all, his love affair with legendary screen goddess, Ava Gardner. Shelton captures the very essence of Sinatra’s aching heart in the a capella rendition of My Foolish Heart that Sinatra sang from his balcony at the Sunset Towers to Gardner’s bungalow below. Shelton could not finish this captivating show without Sinatra’s signature tine, and the audience hung on every note of My Way, the inspirational song that will always be Sinatra’s life lesson to his adoring fans. Shelton has captured the life and songs of the great entertainer and has done it his way.Raw Sinatra sung and spoken with such charm and style by Shelton is a cabaret gem. It was a little subdued by a quiet senior audience, a keyboard, rather than an upright or a grand and the smaller style Spiegel Zelt (Tent). This is a show that would be a hit at the Adelaide Cabaret Festival, and I hope that Shelton may be lured back from LA to perform in the true setting of &nbsp;cabaret.As a parting gesture, Shelton aka Frank Sinatra invites any requests. “New York New York” some cry out. “I haven’t written that yet” Sinatra quickly replies. “It’s a good idea” And with that he leaves his audience wanting more, as every fine entertainer should.",['noreply@blogger.com (Canberra Critics Circle)']

The cancellation of events and  shows across the performing arts is a significant loss of work and income to an  already financially precarious sector.&nbsp;In the TNA 2018 Independent Survey  Report – THIS IS HOW WE DO  IT: Working Trends of Independent Artists, Creatives, and Arts Workers in  Australia&nbsp;– it was shown that respondents worked an average of  8&nbsp;projects&nbsp;across a year, half of which were paid below industry rates. So right  now, we are especially thinking of the independent artists,&nbsp;producers and  presenters who juggle multiple jobs and roles to make a living, and we are  concerned about those who are already marginalised and more vulnerable to the  impacts of the virus, such as Disabled and Deaf artists.What TNA is  doing:1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TNA, together with our  national colleagues are heading into a national industry roundtable with Paul  Fletcher, the Federal Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the  Arts&nbsp;advocating for an immediate and targeted assistance package for Australia’s  performing arts&nbsp;industry.2.&nbsp; &nbsp; We are promoting the value  of the small to medium and independent sectors to the media, and urging stimulus  in multiple areas, including&nbsp;financial assistance for the sector's casual  workers, and an injection of funds to ensure that&nbsp;all 162 short-listed  organisations in the Australia Council's Four Year Funding round can be  supported in the next cycle, providing vital infrastructure to our sector as it  rebuilds over the medium term.&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;TNA has been speaking to  advisors of both major parties and the Greens to seek their support for an  assistance package.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Updating the TNA Resources  Page with relevant resources, links, and  plans from national and international colleagues.&nbsp;What you can  do:1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Log your loss of income  with I Lost My Gig Australia.&nbsp;This will support the combined efforts of our national  colleagues in advocating for an assistance package.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Join in Live Performance  Australia’s campaign #livesupport – All  industry workers are urged to record a short message and let the government know  about the impact of the shutdown on our industry.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the health and safety  of our community seriously, and practise social distancing, and self-isolation  if you are unwell to slow the spread COVID-19.It is an incredibly stressful time  with the loss of work and income, and we also acknowledge how heart breaking it  is to have to cancel shows you’ve worked very hard to bring to life.

Lighting design Matt Cox Premiere production for Sydney Festival and co-produced by Sport For Jove. Supported by Creative Partnerships Austtralia through MATCH LabScott Theatre. Adelaide Festival 2020. March 14-15 2020Reviewed by Peter Wilkins William Zappa’s The Iliad Out Loud is a theatrical masterpiece. For six years, Zappa pored over seventeen translations to create his own version of Homer’s epic saga of the decade long Trojan Wars. The result is nine hours of gripping storytelling, performed in three parts over nine hours at the close of the Adelaide Festival. Actors Blazey Best, Heather Mitchell and Socrates Otto join Zappa in this marathon reading from most of the twenty four books of Homer’s Iliad. Together they breathe life into Homer’s epic poem, switching characters with absolute perfection and uttering with magnificent clarity and conviction the emotional and visual impact of the text. As Zappa says at the start, Homer’s Iliad is likened to an action movie, so graphic in its description of the slaughter, so sensitive in its account of the suffering, so comical in its depiction of squabbling Gods and so compassionate in its regard for the frailties of the human condition. Zappa captures it all in his direction, like a veteran cinematographer panning back for the broad shots of the armies, zooming in for the closeups on the individual Greek, Trojan or God and all the time allowing his stage tapestry of action to captivate an audience, hanging on every word, journeying with the actors through a virtual landscape of&nbsp; sea and sand, walls and trenches, palaces and celestial seats of the omniscient, omnipotent immortal Gods.&nbsp;William Zappa in The Iliad Out Loud&nbsp;Long banners on either side of the stage list&nbsp; on stage right the Greek Gods supporting Achilles’ fleets as they set off from Greece to rescue Menelaus’s adbucted wife&nbsp; Helen from Paris, the son of the Trojan King Priam. On stage left the Gods supporting the Trojans, with Zeus as the head God are listed above the Trojan tribes and the leading Trojan characters, including the abducted Helen. Audiences can swiftly gaze from side to side as names are mentioned, characters face each other from either side and Gods interject, interfere and argue and debate amongst themselves whether soldiers may live or die. Three huge cymbals like giant Greek shields hang in front of a painted copper embossed backdrop. In front of them Michael Askill accompanies the action on drums, while Hamed Sadeghi sits at the side, strumming the Persian Oud. The music is subtle, atmospherically conjuring the auspicious tension of the evolving drama.&nbsp; The actors with script in hand, sit at the side of the large circle of sand in centre stage Zappa introduces each book, and opens each part with a precis of the story for audiences who may not have remained for the entire cycle.Socrates Otto and Blazey Best in The Iliad Out LoudAnd all the time Homer’s rich tapestry of love and war, of fear and courage, of kindness and cruelty, of power and powerlessness before the mighty Gods unfolds through the spoken word of consummate actors creating magic moments&nbsp; without artifice or spectacle It is their art that so engagingly creates each distinctive player in this tragic event. We are swept along by the drama, intently bound to listen and imagine, utterly spellbound by the storytellers, just as they would have been three thousand years before. It is the seamless fluidity of the production that gives it such magnetism. Zappa’s direction creates a dance upon the sand, through which the actors revolve, advance, appear as different characters and exit. In the oral tradition it is the lesson of humanity seen through the prism of the Trojan War but spoken for all time. It is a world where Gods are human and heroes godlike and Homer’s epic poem in Zappa’s version assumes immortality.It is little wonder that at the close of Part Three, the audience spontaneously rose to their feet to applaud a remarkable work and a perfect finale to the 2020 Adelaide Festival.",['noreply@blogger.com (Canberra Critics Circle)']

Are you a schnitzel-lover?

The Bavarian has introduced The Schnitzelmeister Challenge ($80). It’s a 6-stack of chicken schnitzels topped with ham, cheese and napoli sauce, plus you get 4 sides of your choice. If a single individual can finish it ALL on their own, they can have the meal for free!

There is no way I could ever finish off that challenge so I didn’t even attempt it. But we did invite two of our friends and their young children to help us out.

I chose the fries, potato salad, sauerkraut and red cabbage as the 4 sides. There’s layers of ham, cheese and sauce in between each schnitzel and it’s all held together with two steak knives. It was just about the slide off due to the gooeyness of the cheese but Mr FPJ managed to restick it somehow so I could get a photo.

A single schnitzel is small-medium in size. Due to all the toppings, what would normally be a crunchy crumbed exterior goes soft pretty quickly. But it’s offset by the yummy melted cheese and ham! The size of the sides are not small either. The fries are golden and well-seasoned in secret spices.

Between the four adults plus two kids, we didn’t finish it. If you’re not interested in the challenge, it’s still good value at $80 if shared between at least four adults.

Thanks to The Bavarian Woden for hosting us.

https://foodpornjournal.com/2020/03/eating-in-england-part-2-the-fat-duck/,Eating in England – Part 2 – The Fat Duck,2020-03-22 06:18:24+11,1584857904,"Before we had even booked our flights to the UK, but knowing that we would be going, I quickly jumped online to book a table at Heston Blumenthal’s The Fat Duck, three months in advance. Because priorities! We had to prepay for the full meal with the booking which cost 325£ per person. A hefty price and the most expensive meal we’ve had to date, but it’s been a bucket list item for a while.

About a month prior to the reserved date, I receive an email from our ‘storyteller’ at The Fat Duck with a link to a survey asking questions like ‘What makes you most feel ‘like a kid in a sweet shop?’, and ‘What nostalgic memory transports you totally ‘into the moment’, and are there special sights, sounds, smells, flavours or objects that you associate with it?’. We filled it in excitedly and couldn’t wait for the day.

Following on from Eating in Bath, we drive to Bray for our 12 noon reservation at The Fat Duck. Parking is easy as the restaurant has its own car park across the road. There is no blatant signage so I didn’t know where the restaurant was actually located on the street until I noticed the webbed spatula hanging from above.

A sign next to the door is of the The Fat Duck coat of arms with ‘Question Everything’ written underneath.

We open the front door and greeted (very quickly that I’m guessing it’s someone’s duty to stand by the door to let people in) before walking down a long dark corridor to enter the restaurant. I’m grateful that our table is right by the window with lots of light. Placed on each table are napkins and a magnifying glass.

Our ‘storyteller’ wanders over to introduce himself. He asks if we want still or sparkling water in a thick and heavy accent. He then wheels over a cart and places some cards in front of us to make a selection for our welcome drink – a nitro-aperitif.

Once we give him our preferences, he pours a mixture onto a spoon and puts it into the liquid nitrogen (at 106 degrees) to freeze.

I tell him that I don’t drink alcohol, and could something non-alcoholic be made up instead. This is fine and I choose a faux Paloma while Mr FPJ orders the vodka, lime and soda. Out pops a small meringue-like ball and we’re told to pop it into our mouths quickly so that it doesn’t melt. Crispy exterior but soft inside, zesty and refreshing.

We’re also given the wine list which is heavily marked up. A bottle you could get at the shops can cost three times as much here!

A fold-out map with the culinary itinerary of our Fat Duck lunch is provided to the table. Some of the writing is tiny and we realise that’s the purpose of the magnifying glass. There are 7 chapters (courses) to the lunch.

Our waiter brings out a breakfast menu card where we tick the items we would like. This then comes out in Chapter 2. We tick our items and hand the cards back. In hindsight, this is just a bit of fun but it doesn’t actually matter what you tick as you get a set course anyway.

We each decide to start off with some juices (8.50£ each) while the wine list is slowly looked through.

Chapter 1: The Day Before We Go: Are we nearly there yet?

This dish is titled ‘Just the tonic we need‘, and consists of a tonic of botanicals that’s poured onto our plate served with Jerusalem artichoke ice cream.

Slightly herbaceous but balanced with the creamy smooth and subtle artichoke ice cream.

Chapter 2 – Morning: Rise and Shine, it’s breakfast time

We had a sneak peek of what was to come for this course when ticking our options on the menu card earlier. We each receive a board with a small cute loaf (a buttermilk fan tan) that had a lovely glaze over the top. Next to it are clotted cream and a tomato coffee jam jar.

I’m not sure about the tomato coffee jam, thinking it might be more like a chutney, but it tastes like a regular sweet jam with a subtle coffee kick.

The fan tan is super soft and fluffy, and I polish this off so quickly. I could have eaten another one to myself.

Part of this chapter is the ‘Why do I have to choose between a variety pack and a cooked breakfast?‘

A variety pack of 6 mini cereal boxes is placed on the table, and we’re asked to pick one box from one side, and a second box on the other side. Our storyteller tells us that the same thing is in each box so there’s no need to worry about missing out on anything.

On closer inspection of the boxes, I realise they are all custom-made by The Fat Duck and each one has a different inscription. We’re both impressed by the level of detail.

Along with the cereal boxes, we’re given a small bowl filled with truffle egg mousse and bacon cream. Again I love the little details, like the writing on the edge of the bowls.

The bowl contains layers of truffle egg mousse, jellied tomato consommé, bacon, and toasted bread cream. We’re told to pour our cereal over the top and eat it. Mixed together, it actually tastes like I’m eating an English breakfast. There’s egg, bacon, tomato and delicious savoury flavours. So strange yet so cool.

The second cereal box is filled with small wooden puzzle pieces and we’re told to assemble it to obtain a sweet treat later on.

This turns into a little coin box.

The ‘Excuse me, my team seems to be cold…and hot‘ arrives next. The tea is served in double walled glasses and we’re told to quickly take a sip. I don’t know how because it doesn’t make sense, but the tea is both hot and cold at the same time. My mind is blown. It’s marvelous! I’m guessing we had to drink it quickly before the two temperatures melded together to become lukewarm.

Chapter 3 – Mid-morning: First one to see the sea

The ‘Sound of the Sea‘ is the first dish to arrive for Chapter 3. We each have a large sea conch placed in front of us filled with headphones attached to an ipod mini. We’re asked to put these on while eating the meal that arrives next. I insert the earphones and can hear the sound of waves and seagulls.

The dish is placed on a glass box filled with Venezuelan sand consisting of kingfish sashimi, octopus, tapioca ‘sand’, caviar, sea succulents and more. It looks like the foam from the waves crashing in when it meets the shoreline. The foam uses the salty juices of seaweed, abalone, cockles and clams. Lots of flavours from the sea in this dish.

Next came some fish and chips. I love eating fish and chips on the beach, so I thought the sound of the sea worked better with this than the previous dish. Each cone of chips is a print out of The Fat Duck Times newspaper (printed in the month and year we dined) which has Heston’s recipe for triple cooked chips on it. In all honesty, I think the chips could have been fried a tad longer to make them crispier!

‘Can I have some money for an ice cream?‘ arrives next. This is another wooden tray filled with pebbles and sand, with two sticks of ice cream. The ‘rocket’ ice cream on the left has the flavours of a waldorf salad (celery, apple, walnuts, grapes) which I was not expecting! Yet it’s still sweet and juicy. The ice cream on the right is a salmon, avocado, and horseradish twister which I did not like (wasabi in ice cream does not give me pleasure).

After we finish off the ice creams, a third ice cream come outs. Small cones called crab and passionfruit 99s (paying homage to the Cadbury ice cream cone with a Cadbury flake inserted into it made in the Birmingham UK factory which became known as a 99). The crab bisque ice cream actually pairs nicely with the sweet and sour passionfruit. This is my favourite of the three ice creams.

The dishes are cleared and we have time to reflect on the course, when ‘Then we went rockpooling‘ arrives. A waitress pours a small jug of velouté of white chocolate and sea vegetables onto the dish of cornish crab, smoked caviar, and golden trout roe.

I don’t particularly like this dish as I’m not a fan of white chocolate and I thought it made everything too sweet (in what my brain thinks should be a simple savoury dish).

Chapter 4 – Afternoon: If you go down to the woods today…

The next part of the journey continues into the woods. A green miniature forest covered in moss encased in glass arrives at the table. Our waiter begins to pour liquid nitrogen into the side.

The plant is completely covered and the billows of smoke covers the table and our dish. The scent of the woodlands is in the air.

The ‘Damping through the boroughgroves‘ dish of mushroom, beet and blackberry, black truffle, fig leaf, oakmoss, meadowsweet and melilot (sweet clover) arrives at the table. We enjoy this while watching the liquid nitrogen slowly disappear and reveal the smell and sight of the plant. As per the theme, it’s quite an earthy dish and too strong for Mr FPJ (who doesn’t appreciate truffles). It’s not something I would choose to order again but I’m happy with the sweet blackberry gel that helps offset the earthier elements.

When we glance at other tables, we can see that all the plants are different. The one at the table to our left seemed to be covered in ‘snow’ while the one to the right of us seemed to be covered in red autumn leaves. We must have received the Spring plant.

Mr FPJ also orders a drink to accompany this course. He doesn’t remember what it was and all I can see on the receipt is that it’s called ‘A dash of Jerez’ for 20£ (that’s about AUD $40!). It’s the only alcoholic beverage ordered.

The journey takes us onto ‘…we discovered the mock turtle picnic‘ where we’re given bookmarks with a bit of history about the mock turtle story.

A timber box, glass tea pot and cup sets are placed in front of us. The box is opened to reveal a golden watch made from beef stock powder covered in gold leaf. In the cup, there is a gelatinous turnip ‘egg yolk’ with small beef cubes, pickled turnip and cucumbers.

We’re asked to lift up the watch by the attached string, and place it into the tea pot which had been filled with some hot water.

We’re asked to slowly swirl it around which lets the ‘watch’ melt into the hot water. The stock is aromatic and I breathe it in as it swirls around.

We then pour the mixture over the top of our cups to put the finishing touch on the mock turtle soup. There are rich flavours in the soup yet it’s a light consommé. The ‘egg yolk’ and ‘egg white’ is made from swede and turnip juices with gelatin.

A toast sandwich is also delivered to the table to accompany the soup. This is filled with layers of black truffle, egg mayonnaise, egg yolk mustard, tomato ketchup, cucumber, bone marrow salad, gastrique sauce and a sliver of toast between two pieces of white bread. So many elements to this one tiny sandwich which is delicious. It’s too bad that it only lasted a few bites.

Chapter 5 – Evening: Are you ready for dinner?

We are shown the 3-course dinner menu for Chapter 5. There are two mains to choose from, so we choose one of each (the fish and the lamb) to share.

Dinner includes an amuse bouche of aerated beetroot with a layer of horseradish cream. Not too spicy and reminded me of a crispier odd macaron.

A side of house made bread and butter arrives.

The dish I’m most excited about is The Fat Duck’s iconic snail porridge which comes as the starter. This lived up to the hype and I’m glad I got to dig into a bigger serving than expected. An entire whole bowl to myself! Snail butter, snail and chicken stock, ham, fennel, sherry vinegar, oats, mushrooms, shallots and so much more are in this snail porridge. Heston states it is best as a starter but I could seriously eat this as a main meal. Wonderfully sumptuous comfort food, a nice hit of garlic and parsley butteriness, salt from the ham, well seasoned and overall delicious flavour. The snails aren’t rubbery but have a nice chewy texture.

The lamb come with caviar, cucumber, onion, dill and gravy. The meat is succulent with crispy crackling on top. The blackberry gel gives a bit of sweet fruitiness to the otherwise savoury dish.

The fish of the day is turbot which comes with walnut, artichoke, truffle and madeira. It’s such a big piece and cooked to perfection with similar soft textures and flavours so that the fish really stands out.

A tea menu arrives and I can’t help but smile at the quirky artwork.

I order the Kyoto Oolong 2017 while Mr FPJ orders a La Joya Oscura espresso with milk. The coffee has notes of bourbon in it.

Dessert titled ‘Botrytis Cinerea‘ is next (which is basically grey mould when I google what it means). The plate looks magnificent with some dominant tones of gold. There are so many different elements here – aerated saffron grape juice, vanilla and fenugreek infused pear balls, citrus sorbet and reduction, grape gel, peach wine gum, churros stalks, crystalised chocolate, grape ‘leaves’, chocolate balls, a grape sugar bubble and spiral and so much more. I read that there are 80 ingredients, over 20 different elements and 55 stages of preparation. Wow!

A stand of whiskey gums arrives next with whiskeys from around the UK and USA as the dinner digestif. I have a little taste of the Laphroag which is super smokey (like kissing a campfire) and unpleasant for me.

Mr FPJ spots another table with gums in different colours and asks a waitress whether there is a non-alcoholic version of the gums (since I don’t drink alcohol). She says no it’s just the whiskey gums, but another table clearly has coloured gums. When our storyteller comes back to check on us, we ask him the same question, and yes there are tea gums available and he’ll bring it right out. (In hindsight, I should have stipulated that in the dietary requirements.) Tea gums from the UK, China, Japan and India are much more palatable. I got to try Russian Caravan, Jasmine pearls, Hojicha, Matcha and Earl Grey tea flavours.

Chapter 6 – Bedtime: Off to the Land of Nod

The journey takes us to bedtime, and the most amazing and magical thing happens with the ‘Counting Sheep‘ course.

A pillow hovers and spins magically in the air with two delicate looking meringues on top.

After taking several photos of this, we thought we’d better eat the malt milk meringues. Light and airy, just like a cloud, and fitting for the presentation.

Chapter 7 – And then to dream…

The final course is titled ‘Like a kid in a sweetshop‘ and I very much like the sound of that! A cart with a toy house on top is wheeled around the restaurant, and it’s finally wheeled towards our table.

We’re told to hand over our coins from our coin box to pay for the sweets in the sweet shop.

I love the detail like the individual miniature lolly jars through the window.

Our storyteller then turns a wheel on the side of the cart to open the sweet shop up.

Once fully open, he inserts the coin and all the drawers start to move until one is left open. See my insta video below.

The contents in that draw are poured into a sweet shop paper bag for us to take home.

The four sweets include an ox choc (layers of nougat, shortbread and caramel encased in chocolate), caramel in edible wrapper, mandarin scented aerated chocolate (the construction process involves a cream charger, nitrogen gas and a vacuum oven), and a Queen of Hearts jam tart.

The Fat Duck seal on the back of the envelope is also made from chocolate! No I didn’t lick it randomly, but I noticed it melted quickly on my fingers.

Inside the envelope, lay the Queen of Hearts jam tart made with white chocolate.

The back of the Queen of Hearts

By now, it’s 4.00pm and we’ve spent 4 hours at The Fat Duck. The bill arrives for payment of our juices, alcoholic beverage and an optional 12.5% service charge.

What do I think about the experience?

Pros

I don’t think I will ever experience something quite as fun as The Fat Duck. It does a great job of taking you through a fun journey, offering a multi-sensory dining experience, throwing in some surprise quirks along the way, and having beautiful presentation to each course. The technique, flavours and textures are well executed. Some foods are made to look like other things to mess with your mind. The little details are extraordinary. There is wow factor, there is liquid nitrogen, there is joyfulness.

Cons

The wine list at The Fat Duck is super expensive. One glass alone is about 2-3 times the cost of buying an entire bottle at the shops. I’m not sure how that can be justified.

Our storyteller, although very pleasant, had a thick European accent. We actually couldn’t understand the majority of what he was saying, which took away from the whole ‘story’ being told. The table next to us started about 15 minutes after us so we were hopeful to eavesdrop on what their storyteller was saying, but she also had a thick European accent! I think this definitely took away from the whole experience.

I don’t understand the purpose of the survey we filled in a month prior to the reservation date. It didn’t make any difference to the meal or experience. A friend tells me she received a momento about her memories which was filled into her survey. Other blogs also mention something special during their experiences at The Fat Duck, but we got nothing. Our storyteller did mention one of my favourite experiences being the beach, but I guess the Sound of the Sea component was meant to cover that off? I still can’t help feeling disappointed.

There is an optional 12.5% service charge that you pay on the day, after you’ve paid for the full cost of the meal. It is optional so you could choose not to pay it, but we felt guilty.

After seeing a 50% discount on The Fork app, I booked in (a couple of times) with some friends.

Peking duck pancakes ($12.50 for a serve of two) come filled with large meaty slices of duck, cucumber, spring onion and hoisin sauce. I’m actually really happy with the juicy large serving of meat.

The pork wontons in chilli sauce (price unknown) are plump and have a nice mild kick to them, but aren’t overly spicy unless you eat a whole heap of chilli seeds.

The deep fried salt and pepper jumbo king prawns ($24.90) is my favourite dish. The prawns really are jumbo size, and the seasoning is a perfect blend of salt, pepper, dry cut chilli and garlic. So moreish. We ordered this every time and it never disappoints. You’ll see in the background of the photo below, the special fried rice and the stir fried noodles with pork. They didn’t make an impression and honestly I’ve had better versions elsewhere.

The salt and pepper calamari ($23.90) has the same seasoning, but we found it became a little bland after a few mouthfuls. I prefer the juicier jumbo king prawns to the calamari.

The wasabi wagyu beef cubes ($38.90) are delicious – thick square tender chunks and smothered in a wasabi-mix sauce. There isn’t too much of a wasabi hit – it’s actually very subtle. It’s not a large portion but is a high quality melt-in-your-mouth cut of beef and I could easily have finished it off all by myself.

The mixed seafood with vegetables (price unknown) comes on a sizzling plate with prawns, fish, scallops, squid, mushrooms, carrot and snow peas tossed through lots of garlic. It smells amazing and this is another dish where I can really have the entire thing to myself. Juicy seafood and vegetables cooked in a way so that it still has some crunch.

The Shantung lamb ($33.90) has a bit of crispness but soon turns soft from the sauce. I enjoy this – there’s a lot of meat provided (a few bones too), and lots of flavour.

The chicken and vegetables (price unknown) is nice but doesn’t have the punchy flavour of the other dishes. However, it’s still a decent dish.

For dessert, I tried the ‘Swan Lover’ (price unknown). The menu only states it’s made of sweet potato pastry puff with ice cream. The pastry is super thin and crispy, and the inside is filled with taro paste. It’s served warm with a scoop of ice cream on the side. I love taro so this is an enjoyable dessert for me, but not for others.

I recommend the salt and pepper jumbo king prawns and the wasabi beef cubes. Prices are on the expensive side – you’re paying for the table cloths, linen napkins and location on the Kingston Foreshore. So the half price deal was great to try out the menu. Service is friendly but it’s difficult getting a recommendation on what’s good, as they say everything is good!

“Go hard or go home” motivates those who want to get ahead and achieve something. It praises focus and hard, almost inhuman effort. But, how does this saying stand in the time of the current crisis? In a time when we may just need to do the opposite.

When in pandemic, ‘go home’ first and do not take it as a punishment or some kind of negative outcome. It is simply our contribution to public health and safety. It is our collective contribution to help slow down the speed of the virus spread and help our hospitals cope with the surge in demand from those in need.

As far as ‘go hard’ is concerned, we believe that we need to instead learn to become more clever, connected and creative. We need to be ‘soft’ as we make decisions that impact staff and small business suppliers, and as we care about each other, recognising the huge threat to our mental health and general well-being. As we work remotely, as digital natives, we need to develop a range of new ‘soft’ skills. Our emotional intelligence is tested at the next level when we are not in the same room as others. How do we sense tensions or excitement? How do we motivate each other and improve team morale? How do we socialise, give and take feedback, how do we manage emotionally?

The good news is that these turbulent times also bring very new opportunities. As we go, we will be learning rapidly about the seismic shifts happening around us in real time. Things will keep changing and evolving, customers may change and their problems will definitely change. Entire industries will change and we will need to respond and adapt as we go.

This tension between vision, changing environment and the need to respond quickly and efficiently is what innovation and entrepreneurship is all about. And in fact, we already have a huge body of knowledge and experience with how to navigate and respond in a rapidly changing environment. Our startups do it all the time!

Not enough cash? Ask any founder what it feels like to manage through the bootstrapping stage and operate as a lean startup.

Ask any founder what it feels like to manage through the bootstrapping stage and operate as a lean startup. Don’t have an office or working across multiple locations? This is a daily reality for many startups that prioritise how to spend every single dollar.

This is a daily reality for many startups that prioritise how to spend every single dollar. Pivoting and adapting to ever changing customer demands? How else can a startup land their first real contract?

How else can a startup land their first real contract? Technology breaks? Yes it does, all the time. Once you accept that it will, you will design, test and deploy differently.

Crisis tests you and you have an opportunity to emerge more resilient as a team or an organisation. And Canberra startups are already responding to the crisis. As medical researchers, governments and citizens around the world are fighting to contain COVID-19, local Canberra startup Health Horizon has published a live channel tracking upcoming vaccines, diagnostics and other innovations that assist in bringing an end to the pandemic.

At the Canberra Innovation Network we care about how we as an economy and society become more clever, connected and creative. We believe this can be achieved through entrepreneurship at all levels – in the garages and bedrooms where entrepreneurs often start, in the research labs, inside businesses and corporations where intrapreneurs are keen to explore new opportunities. The current evolving crisis caused by COVID-19 creates a lot of pressure but also opportunities for all of us to be more entrepreneurial, more responsive and agile (perhaps less strategic but definitely more practical). We encourage all of you to think about what you can do.

We will be taking our collaborative innovation and lean innovation workshops and courses online, and our growing network of experts and mentors will be working remotely to help our client innovators navigate through this crisis to prepare and capture these new opportunities.

To help us with the details of our online engagement with the innovation community, we would like to ask you to participate in this quick survey.","Written by Petr Adamek, CEO of Canberra Innovation Network.

Apologies if you get it twice.

COVID-19 AND CANBERRA QUILTERS

In view of the most recent announcement of the Prime Minister, the Committee and I have sadly decided that all Canberra Quilters’ activities at Cook will be suspended for the time being. Regretfully the increasing risk to our members has now reached a point where this action needs to be taken.

This suspension will take effect from today and relates to all Special Interest Groups, drop-ins, sew-ins and friendship group meetings. This also includes all night and day meetings, and includes the AGM which was scheduled for 2 April. Janice Nangle our Workshop Coordinator will be in touch with members booked to undertake workshops.

For members who are not aware, our Exhibition dates have moved to 10-13 September 2020 which coincides with Floriade. Further information will be circulated by the Exhibition Coordinator regarding any date changes for entries.

The length of this suspension of activities is uncertain at this time. Once the Committee has had an opportunity to consider the impact of the directive on the closure of non-essential activities, a further Bulletin will be circulated.

I encourage members to stay in contact with each other either by email or by phone or by virtual means. This may be an opportunity to use Messenger to chat to each other or to use one of the other platforms such as WhatsApp, Google Hangouts, Discord etc. to keep in touch.

I would like to thank Canberra Quilters members for cooperating with, and implementing changes, as they have been put in place.

https://citynews.com.au/2020/panic-buying-its-all-perfectly-rational-to-dr-dirk/,"Panic buying, it’s all perfectly rational to Dr Dirk",2020-03-25 01:27:34+11,1585099654,"Share Canberra's trusted news:

“PANIC buyers” responding to the coronavirus pandemic have been condemned by politicians and media outlets across the nation, but a Canberra behavioural insight specialist says it’s not as ridiculous as people think.

“It’s quite rational,” says Dr Dirk Van Rooy, who works as a behavioural insight specialist at ThinkPlace and a senior lecturer at ANU.

“There is a difference between disaster preparation and what we refer to as ‘panic buying’. Disaster preparation would be rational. Stocking up on supplies for 14 days when you’re not sure what will happen is rational.

“Fear for a virus outbreak is also quite rational.

“This is a very complicated issue, there is a lot of uncertainty and even the experts don’t know the answers at this point.”

Dirk believes the term “panic buying” is misleading, and instead, he says what Australians are seeing are psychological mechanisms fuelled by fear.

When people are fuelled by fear or anxiety, their brains evaluate threats in a different way, according to Dirk, who says a lot of decision making relies on emotions.

“It usually works quite well to rely on emotions and mental shortcuts but it becomes problematic when there is heightened fear and anxiety,” he says.

A lot of this has to do with the human ability to perceive risks, and Dirk says: “We’re not very good at risk perceptions.”

“We find it very difficult to process representations of risks because they tend to be represented with statistics or ambiguous words,” he says.

Then, when there’s ambiguity, Dirk says people respond by stocking up on items such as toilet paper as a psychological mechanism to deal with this uncertainty.

“It’s a way of measuring control over the situation,” he says.

“It’s not necessarily driven by need.”

Dirk compares it with retail therapy, saying that people use retail therapy as a coping mechanism. Their desire to buy things, again, isn’t driven by a need, he says.

“People feel the need to do something big. Handwashing might seem too trivial so a dramatic response is recognised, leading people to throw money at things,” he says.

“That is, in itself, the behaviour that reduces the anxiety even though it doesn’t result in protection.”

But, as Dirk says, this fear response doesn’t protect people from the virus and also has an impact on the economy.

“What people tend to do in these circumstances is become very conservative. They don’t just hoard toilet paper rolls, they also hoard money,” he says.

While these fear responses are also rational, Dirk says there are ways to reduce this fear, such as reading proper information sources that are validated by experts, and ways for the Federal Government and other governments to reduce it, too.

“There’s some research that provides some key principles for governments on how to communicate,” he says.

“One principle governments can put in place to manage anxiety is to be transparent, so show people the work that’s being done behind the scenes.

“Another way is being clear, simple and precise.”

And, another principle, according to Dirk, is public trust.

“People are far more willing to adopt the recommendations from governments when they feel like governments are being honest,” he says.

“Prime Minister Scott Morrison has a problem here because a lot of people lost trust in him during the bushfires.”

Dirk, who can’t see the Federal government coming back from this distrust, says the best thing they can do is stay out of the process and use medical experts and other experts to explain new measures.

Another reason why the community is seeing more of a divide, compared to when the community came together during the bushfires, is because the virus is invisible.

“There’s a key difference with the bushfire crisis,” he says.

“In general Australians are more familiar with bushfires, even though we might have underestimated the extent of them. The nature of the threat is also different. There’s less of a threat to the whole system.

“Things like viruses or cancer give us a lot of dread because they’re invisible. They creep up on you. Bushfires are a lot more visible.”

The more dread there is, Dirk says there will be more fear, and also a herd mentality response.

“If everyone is running for the lifeboats, you’re going to do the same,” he says.

“But buying out of fear is a self-fulfilling prophecy. The fear of scarcity can actually create scarcity, so panic buying can create real scarcity.

“If people are fighting over hand sanitiser, people will want it, and that will create a shortage. It’s a snowball effect.”","“It’s quite rational,” says Dr Dirk Van Rooy, who works as a behavioural insight specialist at ThinkPlace and a senior lecturer at ANU.

DIANNE Anderson’s park-like Red Hill garden will be open to the public in April for the last time, as she and her husband Brian prepare to downsize later this year.

“This will be our final open garden, after sharing it so many times. We will miss it,” she says of the beautiful space, which has often been used for hosting functions, concerts and music events.

The 4000sqm garden will open on the weekend of April 4-5 as part of Open Gardens Canberra, and music-lover Dianne says she’ll give an impromptu organ performance at some point.

Photos: Holly Treadaway

“We’ve made a lot of changes to the garden since we bought the house in 1997,” she says.

“We designed it with events in mind, raising the lower lawns by a metre to create a place for people to gather near the music room.”

The lawns are the focus here, with a huge 150,000-litre underground water tank and an automatic watering system installed to keep them looking their best.

With tall, shady trees and hedges creating privacy, the garden does double duty as a personal sanctuary for Dianne and Brian.

“It’s very much like a park within the boundaries, with all its pleasant corners and space to wander, and we can close the gates and not hear much from outside,” she says.

Inspired by Monet’s garden of perennials in Giverny, there’s an allée of Manchurian pear, and Dianne says every room in the house – which matches the colour palette – looks out to the garden over lush lawns and heartily crowded flowerbeds in mainly blue and white. The colours were chosen so that Brian would be able to appreciate the contrast despite his red-green colour-blindness.

“I’m mostly working when I’m out here, but it’s relaxing for me to have a day pottering in the garden. It’s my me-time,” Dianne says.

“The garden’s well-established now and though the gardeners do the hedges and edges, I still love to get out here and do a bit of work.

“It will be hard to leave, but I’ll have more time for music, travelling to visit family and playing bridge.”

57 Arthur Circle, Red Hill, will be open on Saturday, October 23 and Sunday, October 24, 10am-4pm. Adults $8, children under 18 are free. Funds raised will go towards rebuilding St Saviour’s Church in Quaama, which burnt down in the recent bushfires. More at opengardenscanberra.org.au/members

In the age of coronavirus, only tiny weddings are allowed and the extended family barbecue is out, says MICHELLE GRATTAN

ONLY five people will be able to attend a wedding – the couple, the celebrant and two witnesses – and funerals will be limited to 10 in the latest round of life-changing restrictions to be imposed on Australians to fight the coronavirus spread.

Real estate auctions and “open house” inspections will be stopped, and Australians will now be prohibited from leaving the country – with some carve outs such as compassionate grounds – rather than just strongly advised not to do so.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison, announcing the new crackdowns, also told people to stay home, except when it was absolutely necessary to go out. But they shouldn’t have the extended family around the dinner table or over to a barbecue.

However parents are still being told it is safe for children to go to school, and today (March 25) Morrison will meet teachers’ union representatives to discuss arrangements to protect staff, especially older teachers more vulnerable to the virus. Schools would need to reopen on the other side of the holidays, he said.

Addressing a news conference after Tuesday night’s federal-state national cabinet, Morrison said the widened list of bans would include food courts in shopping centres, except for takeaways. Outdoor and indoor markets – excluding food markets essential to ensure the food supply across the country – will be dealt with by each state and territory.

A range of personal services, including beauty therapy, tanning, waxing, nail salons and tattoo parlors, will be shut down, as well as spas and massage parlours. This does not extend to physiotherapists and similar allied health services.

Hairdressers and barbers have escaped closure, but with a social distancing limit to the number of people on their premises, and the stipulation a patron can only be there for 30 minutes.

The banned list also includes amusement parks and arcades, play centres (both indoor and outdoor), community and recreation centres, libraries, health clubs, fitness centres, yoga, barre and spin facilities, saunas, and wellness centres. Social sporting events and swimming pools are on the list, as are galleries, libraries and youth centres.

Boot camps may be held outside with no more than 10 people.

Morrison said people should “stay at home unless it is absolutely necessary you go out.

“Going out for the basics, going out for exercise, perhaps with your partner or family members, provided it’s a small group – that’s fine.” As was going out to work, where it was not possible to work from home – but not “participating more broadly in the community”.

Visits to your house “should be kept to a minimum and with very small numbers of guests”.

“So that means barbecues of lots of friends, or even family, extended family, coming together to celebrate one-year-old birthday parties and all these sorts of things, we can’t do those things now,” he said.

“These will be significant sacrifices, I know.

“Gathering together in that way. even around the large family table in the family home when all the siblings get together and bring the kids, these are not things we can do now. All of these things present risks”.

He said states and territories were considering whether they would make it an offence to organise house parties.

“Outdoors, do not congregate together in groups.

“If you’re gathering together in a group, say, 10 people, together outside in a group, that’s not okay. We’ve got to move people on.”

Morrison said that “hopefully” a full shutdown of the retail sector would not be necessary,

“I do note in a lot of the commentary… there seems to be a great wish to go to that point. Well, be careful what you wish for on something like that… because that would need to be sustained for a very long time. And that could have a very significant and even more onerous impact on life in Australia.

“We should seek to try to avoid that where it is possible. But if it is necessary for health reasons, ultimately, those decisions will be taken at the time”.

Asked why an outside boot camp of ten people was allowed, Morrison said “that is a business, that is someone’s livelihood and you’re saying that I should turn their livelihood off. I’m not going to do that lightly. And if it is not believed to be necessary based on the medical expert advice.

“I am not going to be cavalier about people’s jobs and their businesses. Where possible, the national cabinet together is going to try and keep Australia functioning in a way that continues to support jobs and activity in our economy which is not going to compromise the health advice that we’re receiving.

“And so no, I don’t think we should rush to that sort of [shutdown] scenario. I think you could rush to failure in that sort of scenario.

“You could rush to causing great and unnecessary harm because understand this, this country is not dealing with one crisis, we’re dealing with two crises. We are dealing with a health crisis that has caused an economic crisis.

“I am very concerned about the economic crisis that could also take a great toll on people’s lives, not just their livelihoods. The stresses that that will put on families. The things that can happen when families are under stress.

“I am as concerned about those outcomes as I am about the health outcomes of managing the outbreak of the coronavirus and it is a delicate task for the national cabinet to balance those two.

“Lives are at risk in both cases. And so the national cabinet won’t just rush on the sense of an opinion of inevitability. We will calmly consider the medical advice that is put to us and weigh those things up and make sensible decisions as leaders. I will not be cavalier about it and neither will other premiers and chief ministers.”

He apologised for the systems failure that prevented people accessing Centrelink, prompting huge queues with many people who had lost jobs visibly upset.

“We are deeply sorry”, he said. “We have gone from 6000 [online traffic] to 50,000 to 150,000,” all in the matter of a day.

He appealed to people “even in these most difficult of circumstances, to be patient. Everyone is doing their best. What we are dealing with is unprecedented. No system is built to deal with the circumstance and events we are now facing as a nation.”.

Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said the steep growth in the number of cases – the tally is now passed 2000 – was “very concerning”.

Nine reported advice from a group of experts from the Group of Eight universities commissioned by the federal government.

The panel recommended “Australia without delay implements national stronger social distancing measures, more extensive banning of mass gatherings, school closure or class dismissal”.

The group, in advice presented on March 22, also urged “much-enhanced” testing without delay.

It said: “Countries with significant COVID-19 infections have eventually been forced into strong public health measures in a reactive manner. It became unavoidable from a public health perspective.

“The only difference is at what point these measures are implemented, whether proactive or reactive, and how large the resulting epidemic will be.”

“Proactive measures will result in a smaller epidemic and less stress on the health system. Reactive measures (such as in Italy) may result in a greater burden of morbidity and mortality and delay in reaching the point of recovery.‘

The “dominant” position in the group was for “a comprehensive, simultaneous ban across Australia”, but the other view among its participants was for a “more proportionate response”.

With the government going down the latter path, Morrison and Murphy were noticeably uncomfortable when questioned about the advice.

Former prime minister Tony Abbott, who as health minister in 2004 drove preparations for a possible bird flu pandemic, called for a total shutdown.

“We need to have a very, very complete shutdown now to do everything we humanly can to prevent the spread of the disease,” he told 2GB.

“You can only put the economy into a coma for so long, it can’t be indefinite,” he said.

“But the more complete it is now the more likely it is to be short-lived.”

“STRANGE times require creative solutions,” says Gunning artist Margarita Georgiadis as she prepares for the Picture House Art Prize, part of the inaugural Gunning Arts Festival.

Georgiadis is co-owner, with her husband of 17 years, actor-artist Max Cullen, of the Picture House Gallery & Bookshop in Gunning, the former Coronation theatre, on which planned festivities will centre.

Undaunted by the coronavirus scare, she says, “our art prize is most definitely still going ahead and we are still accepting submissions.

“The general consensus among event organisers is that we will host our arts festival online.

“We want to create something for people who are in self-isolation,” she tells us, explaining that while some smaller events could – though they don’t know yet – go ahead live, most performances are suitable for live-streaming.

“The worst-case scenario is that we will have an online art exhibition, which can still be viewed and voted on by the public,” she says.

The Picture House Gallery prize and exhibition, curated by Cullen and Georgiadis and sponsored by Derivan Art Supplies, will give preference to entries that best interpret the festival theme, “Celebrating Nature” and the winner will be announced on May 16.

The prize, a Derivan Matisse prize pack of paints valued at $500 and an offer for the winner to stage a solo exhibition at The Picture House Gallery, will be non-acquisitive (meaning the artist can keep it) but all artworks are expected to be for sale.

It’s open to artists aged over 18 for works in photography, painting, drawing, printing and multimedia, with a People’s Choice Award for the most popular work.

“I know there are many talented artists that live and work in the region… and strongly encourage all artists to apply,” Georgiadis says.

Everyone knows Cullen from his popular appearances on TV, his portrayals of Henry Lawson on stage, or as Travis Hudson in “X-Men” and Owl Eyes in the Baz Luhrmann film “Gatsby”, but Georgiadis, a respected painter who once told “CityNews” that life with Max was “a zany, Dadaistic experience every day”, is also a creative producer with an eye to the future.

The festival has been spearheaded by the Upper Lachlan Shire Council and several Gunning arts practitioners and community cultural groups, including Gunning Focus Group, Dianna Nixon’s Wild Voices Music Theatre, The Picture House Gallery & Bookshop, Creative Gunning, local author Greg Baines and Gunning & District Historical Society.

The gala opening concert on April 17, followed by a day of music, drama, art, book reading, and wearable art fashion on April 18, may have to go online but organisers are sure it will still be fun.

As you would all be aware there is current pandemic outbreak known as Covid-19. I wanted to let you know of the actions taken by CrossFit Canberra and what you can do to keep life as normal as possible and continue training with the CFCBR fam.

CrossFit Canberra will always be in line with the guidelines and measures put into place by the relevant government authorities. It is for this reason that we have kept CrossFit classes running as per normal as it is perfectly safe to do so. Until we receive advice otherwise we will continue to do so.

We do take our responsibility to provide all of our members with a safe environment to train very seriously and have implemented the following measures to minimise the chances of bacterial transfer:

1) Increased general cleaning protocols

2) We ask all members to wipe down any equipment they have used during sessions with antibacterial wipes

3) Provided more disinfectant and antibacterial wipes

4) Signs around the gym about washing hands and the protocol for effectively doing so before and after class

5) We ask that all members refrain from shaking hands, high fives and swap for foot taps or fist bumps

In addition to the above measures, the most effective way to avoid transfer of the virus is for members to not come to the gym if they fit the following criteria:

1) Feeling unwell (whether you think you have the virus or not)

2) Have recently travelled overseas

3) Have been in close contact with a confirmed case of coronavirus

We ask again that if you fit the above criteria that you follow the government health guidelines and self isolate for 14 days and do not attend the gym.

1) Provide you with an at home training program

2) Provide you with the equipment to complete this program

3) Drop this equipment at your house (yes we will give you equipment from the gym and bring it to your house)

So if you are in this position of self isolation now or in the future please contact us via email and we will provide these services for you. We want to look after all of our members in this time of crisis.

Hardship Measures

We understand that this might be a time of financial hardship for our members whose work has been affected by the coronavirus and the economic effects from it. If you have experienced financial hardship due to the coronavirus please contact us.

As the shockwaves from Australia’s response to COVID-19 continue to reverberate around the ACT, local businesses are discovering the need to pivot or perish.

A week ago, Handmade Market’s Managing Director Julie Nicholls was dealing with the biggest business decision she had ever had to make in 12 years of running Handmade. Close the market which was expected to bring 30,000 people into close proximity at EPIC, or try and move it online to salvage what they could in response to COVID19.

She chose the latter, and between Monday and Saturday, she and her tiny team went full pelt to create a new website and bring 273 stallholders into the virtual realm.

Well, the good news is—it worked.

After working 20-hour days wrangling the new website and ensuring the stallholders were ready for the leap, Julie is proud to report that the Handmade Virtual Market drew almost as many online customers as she was expecting through the physical gates.

“We had 28,490 unique visits to the site, and 133,074 page views. It was just extraordinary. Honestly, we are all still in shock at what a success it was.”

While Julie is aware not all stallholders had a good market in terms of sale, for some, the move to online brought them new levels of success and customer contact.

“One woman contacted me to say that she had had 99 sales and it was better than the year before when she was physically standing in her stall at EPIC.”

Julie says that for business owners out there—particularly small retailers—there is hope to salvage a business through the move to online even if its physical doors have to close for the time being.

“For us, it was a question of just giving up and cancelling or trying to keep it together for the short-term so we could sustain the business long-term. It will be the same for so many businesses over the next few weeks and months”.

Julie said the two days were a phenomenal success which points to goodwill and support coming from loyal customers.

“I would suggest for any businesses out there now considering their future, they don’t need to be scared of going online. Spend a little bit of time looking at what is out there to see what is going to fit.”

She also stressed the ease and convenience of Instagram as a marketing tool—at a time when people are clearly glued to their phones.

“Get a good photo and a good description and treat your followers as you would your actual customers. Talk to them, answer their questions, be responsive.”

Over at As Nature Intended at Dairy Road in Fyshwick, owner Beata Wilder has been offering Facetime shopping for customers in response to people avoiding going out. The wholefood market stocks fresh organic fruit and veggies as well as staples such as flour, sugar, and rice.

“Some of these things you can’t get in the supermarket, but we have it all in abundance.”

She said people could talk through nutrition advice and just share their feelings about being in isolation with her or her assistant Sharon. “It is a nice way to provide people with that personal touch and to be able to discuss our products so you can see a smiling face and hear a voice.”

“I think a lot of people are wanting to make sure that they look after their nutritional needs and boost their immunity as much as possible at the moment so if they don’t want to come into the shop, we are doing our best to provide that face-to-face contact and advice.”

Order can be placed over the facetime chat and delivered within the day for a $5 fee within a 10km radius.

“Even if you are craving a fresh juice, we can make it here and deliver you half a litre.”

Similarly, the last week in Canberra has seen a host of restaurants organise home delivery service as their doors close to the public—a decision made by the Federal Government over the weekend.

Hospitality recruitment veteran Chris Hansen is also moving quickly to set up a new online ordering hub for some of Canberra’s most notable restaurants—a move aimed not only at providing some of the city’s top chefs with a living wage but from stopping them leaving the industry altogether.

Canberra Eats will be targeting the middle to higher-end restaurant food delivery market and is launching in the inner north and inner south with between 15-20 venues on board.

Chris expects to sign off on the venture in the next few days.

“We know that hospitality casuals and most of the full-time staff have lost their jobs, but this is a way to keep the chefs at least in the kitchen. When the city finally bounces back from this, it would be a tragedy for us to have lost some of our top talent.”

Canberra Eats will charge a minimum order of $55, with a $10 delivery fee with a radius of around 15-20km per venue. The orders must be in by 5 pm and then allocated a preferred delivery slot (with a half-hour window) between 6-9 pm. The customer will receive a text when the order is dropped on their doorstep so there is no personal contact.

“’Locals supporting their locals’ is our tagline. We want people to consider the businesses in their suburb, the places they normally enjoy and to give them a lifeline.”

Part of the business model is to use drivers who would normally be front of house but have lost their jobs.

“We are recruiting from within the industry.”

“Think of it as a way to bring your favourite chef into your house, where you can order your favourite dish and know that you are playing a small role in keeping that restaurant open for the long-term.”

Even the tiny family-run restaurants are adapting quickly. Dickson’s popular Pho Phu Quoc is joining Menulog from Friday and is using staff to ferry orders out to all inner north suburbs (and a few Belconnen suburbs) for free between 5-9 pm. The minimum spend is just $40 and given a bowl of the restaurant’s famed rare beef pho is only $13.90, it shows how fine the margins are for owner Sue Le who says she is “basically working for free to stay open so we can have a restaurant to come back to.”

Having spent 32 years in the industry, Sue said her family was just hanging on to the business and she cried over the phone as she describes having to let her staff go.

“I am so devastated and heartbroken to see what is happening around the world. It was so terrible to let our staff go. And I am scared. But I’m also grateful to all the loyal customers who are trying to support us by putting in home delivery orders during this time.”

So many Canberrans are keen to do what they can for the industry. Over at the Doughnut Department in Civic, owner Andrea Hutchinson said she was reduced to tears this week when a regular customer came in for a coffee and insisted on paying $100.

“I told him I wouldn’t accept the money but he wouldn’t accept the change,” she said.

Doughnut Department was moving to an online delivery system as well as offering takeaway in the hope that during these bleak days, people would appreciate one of their handmade treats as a small reason for happiness.

“We will keep the business alive for as long as we can, for as long as we have orders,” she said.","Emma MacdonaldAs the shockwaves from Australia’s response to COVID-19 continue to reverberate around the ACT, local businesses are discovering the need to pivot or perish.

Okay, people. Sh*t just got real.

In amongst all the uncertainty about life, the universe and everything, we are now expected to take on personal responsibility for the education of our children.

Some of us may embrace this as an opportunity to fully engage with our young ones on their learning journey. Others of us may be more panicked at the thought of supervising Year 9 Maths than we are of running out of loo paper—like that viral video of a mum ranting over having to help her four kids with distance education in Israel. “Now our children will find out how dumb we are. It’s not right. Really.”

But before you start hyperventilating, let us introduce you to Erinn Pages. She has two school kids and a new baby and started homeschooling the kids two weeks ago.

She takes a positive slant on home learning and is providing some great resources and advice for parents on her @theunofficialhomeschool account on Instagram.

It’s early days yet. But we thought some helpful words from Erinn might set some of you on your way to home learning with a spring in your step.

Why have you set up the account?

I can’t replace our kid’s amazing teachers, however, I thought surely there must be other parents in Canberra and throughout Australia making a similar decision to keep their kids at home.

So I wanted to try and create a central place of conversation—to not only share how we’re going about getting school work completed in isolation but for all parents and carers to feel supported and connected to learning ideas, educational resources and emotional wellbeing information.

What would you like to say to parents who are completely freaked out by the thought of having the kids at home now, and is it realistic to think kids can learn as much at home and online as they do at school?

Canberra parents are already tired after the summer bushfires. More time indoors with their kids over the coming weeks and months will test many, but they do say, “we’re stronger together”.

Not everyone will want a routine nor want to continue formal education at home. But for our family, we need routine and structure for a few reasons.

Our two school-aged sons are already the eldest in their year levels, so we can’t afford to have them repeat another year. One of our sons is also autistic, so having a routine provides a calmer and safer space for everyone in knowing what’s going to happen each day.

We are used to visuals as a way to communicate in our household—so we have pinned up on the wall, what I call the “ish” routine.

Starting the day at 10ish and not on the dot means we’re flexible if the baby needs to be fed or changed, or we decide to go for a walk first up, or I want everyone to tidy up their bedrooms.

I have worked full-time from home before with a toddler and a Kindy kid. In fact, I always worked full-time until this maternity leave, so I know it’s going to be frustrating for parents to juggle working from home, while also ensuring their children are doing school work.

They won’t be able to do as much as they do at school, but I don’t think our teachers will expect that either. This is a unique time, and we have to look after the emotional wellbeing of ourselves as parents too.

Families will need to stay strong and work out what’s most important for their household to achieve in their daily routines.

Schools will all have specific instructions for their kids, but what are some key strategies you would recommend?

I have kept school work time to a two-hour block in the morning before their brains get screen-time fried.

I am not taking away screen time at the moment—the kids need it to connect to their friends. Online social connections are going to be more important than ever during social distancing.

Our two-hour block concentrates on the basics of reading, writing and maths and incorporating knowledge from science, history or geography into these.

Once we get some remote learning curriculum from the school, we will phase ourselves into this and I will rely less on coming up with the content myself.

Some parents may also choose to work in one-hour blocks per child during the day. I have already figured out my Grade 1 child needs more side-by-side support than my Grade 4 child. But then I need to spend more time checking over the work of the Grade 4 child.

I don’t have a high-schooler yet, but online study groups could be an option for helping your kids stay accountable.

Always have a daily check-in time with older kids. You can schedule this like a work meeting in your day.

You also don’t need expensive resources for homeschooling. Simple things you find in the stationery aisle of the supermarket are fine—notebooks, pens, paper. Just please don’t hoard!

Also, if your child doesn’t have an iPad or laptop, ask your school if they can provide one or print the materials for you.

There are a lot of teachers with great Instagram accounts to follow for ideas and resources. I will try and link these from my account for parents to connect to.

But start with what your child’s school provides first and go from there. This is also a time for real-life learning. For example, I want to show my kids how to make their own sandwich—and even how to use a vacuum cleaner!

What should we be aiming for an average day to look like?

My @theunofficialhomeschool routine is definitely the “ish” routine:

7-10ish Get Dressed, Make Your Bed, Eat Breakfast + Do a Chore + Move Your Body

10-12ish School Work + Daily Journal (this is for writing time and also opening up and talking about our feelings during social distancing and isolation)

12-2ish Lunch + Quiet Time

2-3ish Creative Time

3-6ish Free Play + Connect online with friends

6ish Usual Dinner, Bath, Bed routine

For parents, my advice is to check and answer important/urgent emails and do your own exercise at home before school work starts.

When you have to supervise school work and work from home in parallel, just pick one work task or project to concentrate on during this time, and try not to schedule conference calls during this time either.

Use creative time to get kids to help in the kitchen with baking or cooking; fix something in the house or outside; do some gardening; listen to music and dance together; or even learn a language together.

Use Free Play to do what you need to do—either for work or in the house. Let them have their screen time then, so there’s less chance for interruptions!

Erinn will be posting regular tips and resources from her account @theunofficialhomeschool, but remember, your child’s school and individual teacher will be well equipped to help you through this period.

Happy homeschooling, friends.","She has two school kids and a new baby and started homeschooling the kids two weeks ago.

https://hercanberra.com.au/cpcity/canberra-liveable-and-inclusive-city/,Could Canberra become the world’s most liveable and inclusive city?,2020-03-24 19:00:54+11,1585076454,"Catherine Carter

Is Melbourne the world’s most liveable city? Or has Vienna pipped it to the post? Will Sydney take the top spot this year or is Zurich still the shining star?

Each new round of city rankings triggers debates about their merits, but they continue to attract headlines and the headspace of city leaders the world over.

Last year, after the Economist Intelligence Unit’s global liveability index ranked Melbourne and Sydney second and third, even our prime minister couldn’t resist giving the first placed Austrian capital a ribbing. “Vienna’s beaches are rubbish,” he said.

?It’s easy to laugh, but comparisons have consequences. Politicians, policymakers and global firms often draw on city performance measures to make decisions, whether that’s about the efficacy of a city policy or the best option for a new office opening.

And hidden behind these rankings is another story.

In Vienna, routinely named the world’s most liveable city, 60% of lower income households have difficulties making ends meet and a third of residents are not eligible to vote in elections that shape the future of their city because they don’t hold Austrian citizenship.

Zurich, another favourite, faces decreasing social mobility. Just 20% of Zurich’s school leavers are able to even apply for places at university and, until recently, it was difficult for even third generation migrants to obtain citizenship.

Closer to home, Melbourne has ranked first on the Global Liveability Index for 10 of the last 18 years. As Invest Victoria crows: “Melbourne’s liveability is a key factor in the city’s attractiveness for investors who can use the lure of living in one of the world’s most liveable cities to recruit and retain talented professionals.”

But Melbourne also boasts the fourth least affordable housing market in the world, according to the 2020 Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey. The average house now costs 9.5 times the average household income.

Homelessness in Melbourne is on the rise. In the three years to 2018, homelessness among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Victoria grew by 22%

And consider the words of wheelchair user and Melbourne resident Stacey Christie: “One day, I’d love to not have to think about accessibility. Every building, event and public transport option in Melbourne would be wheelchair accessible and I could simply go about my day like everyone else, not having to plan my day around accessibility.”

That doesn’t sound very liveable, does it?

As Feargus O’Sullivan says in article for CityLab, liveability rankings assesses a city’s potential “from a privileged point of view: that of a straight, affluent, mobile, and probably white couple who works in something akin to upper management and has children”.

But what does all this have to with Canberra?

Last month, city specialist and PwC partner Emma Thomas, and PwC’s Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, Julie McKay joined me for a Salon Canberra event to explore what inclusion means for our city.

Emma and Julie are considering a framework for inclusion that encompasses a range of dimensions: age, mobility, language, heritage, ethnicity, gender and sexual preference among them.

Emma says inclusion is an important consideration of a city’s true liveability.

“Australian cities do well on liveability indices because our society is relatively prosperous and we have good infrastructure and amenity. But there is a danger. By measuring your city on liveability alone, you may miss out on the fact that your liveability is not for everyone.”

“As places have become more liveable they’ve become less affordable. How do we create more inclusive cities where everyone can access the “liveable” elements regardless of their income status or mobility? We haven’t quite worked that out.”

Measuring leads to better management and better policy development, so an assessment of our city’s inclusivity seems a good place to start.

Looking at the way we build cities through an inclusion lens doesn’t always mean spending a lot of money. Emma points to the example of Singapore, where senior citizens are given priority at pedestrian crossings with a swipe card that allows them to cross at their own pace.

Locally, libraries are being reimagined not just as repositories for books, but as meeting places for people to “see a friendly face” and to connect.

Julie cites the recent work done in Barcelona, to see livability and city design through women’s eyes.

“What is clear is that many women and vulnerable people don’t feel safe in our cities and safety means something different to each individual. Unless safety and inclusivity have been considerations in the planning and development of a city, then things will have been missed.”

“We assume that everyone is connected, integrated and mobile, but many people are being left out. A truly liveable city is one where everyone can connect and feel like they are not isolated or unsafe.”

It’s this idea of connectivity that may be key to building more inclusive cities.

This month the ACT Government launched its ACT Wellbeing Framework which seeks to capture and identify a range of factors that contribute to quality of life, intended to shape priorities for government decision making and Budget investment going forward.

It’s a good initiative that shows how Canberra is already shifting its thinking. Ongoing conversations, where we can all share our ideas for the future of our city will be important as we work to shape our collective future, our quality of life, the type of community we want to have and the sort of city we aspire to live in.

https://hercanberra.com.au/cpfood/brodburger-home-delivery/,Brodburger hits the road offering home delivery,2020-03-23 23:54:27+11,1585007667,"HerCanberra Team

It started as a charming little red caravan in Kingston’s Bowen Park—now Canberra icon Brodburger is going back to its travelling roots as it responds to the COVID-19 crisis.

Canberra’s hospitality industry is doing it tough in light of recent restrictions imposed on venues in a bid to combat the outbreak of COVID-19. But rather than wave the white flag, we’re seeing many businesses think outside the square to find ways to keep operating.

Local burger icon Brodburger is the latest to announce they’re getting innovative with their approach to feeding the people of Canberra.

Kicking off at lunchtime today at their Kingston outlet, Brodburger will be offering home delivery to those who live within a 6-kilometre radius of the store, via their online ordering application.

“We wanted to control our home delivery service by our team, and not via third party, to ensure we keep our staff employed during this tough time,” says co-owner Joelle Brodbeck.

“But it also means we can better control the hygiene and sanitation of the burgers during their transport, as well as maintain the quality of the food as a whole.”

The app is an extension of their already successful online ordering platform, created by technology innovation company, Datapos.

“Datapos have been working really closely with us to get this up and running as quickly as possible since the developments last week. They have been amazing and are looking at facilitating more local businesses onto a similar online ordering platform over the coming weeks,” explains Joelle.

Additionally, home delivery will soon be available to those who live within 6-kilometres of Brodburger’s new Dickson location at Coop at Soho.

“We’re looking at having home delivery ready for when we open in Dickson this Thursday, but it may take us a little longer … we’re working as quickly as we can and will keep our customers updated via social media.”

Customers can still pre-order online and pick up their favourite burgers from Kingston and Dickson. While the venues themselves have closed, the team have set up temporary windows from which customers can grab their food, without contact with staff. Extra sanitisation measures have also been put in place.

“We still really encourage people to order online for pick-up if able and feeling well. You’ll also know if you aren’t eligible for home delivery from the outset, because the app will tell you,” says Joelle.

“We are even working on creating a drive-through contactless pick-up system, which we can provide more details on very soon.”

Brodburger at the Capital Brewing Co Taproom in Fyshwick is temporarily closed, but customers can still get their Capital fix from Brodburger Kingston.

“We will have all the core range of beers and specialty crowlers freshly filled from the Brewery. We’re just working with liquor licensing and Capital Brewing on extending that to takeaway orders as soon as possible,” says Brodbeck.

Jim Murphy’s offering free delivery for six bottles or more…and throwing in a free bottle for HerCanberra readers!

It feels like the end of days. Also, it feels like a mighty good time to open a bottle of wine.

Canberra’s largest independent family-run liquor retailer Jim Murphy’s is making things easier. It is now offering free delivery for any six or more bottles of wine, fortified wine or spirits to anywhere in Canberra or Queanbeyan.

Jim Murphy’s son AJ, who now runs the businesses, said, “We aim for same day dispatch for all orders received before 2 pm, and local customers in Canberra and Queanbeyan will usually receive their delivery on the day of despatch.”

Customers can still take advantage of the Click and Collect service, where purchases can be picked up in-store at Jim Murphy Market Cellars or Jim Murphy Express.

AJ said it had been a difficult start to the year but there had been a small rise in sales in recent weeks as people sought to prepare for weeks and/or months of self-isolation.

“At least if people start to stockpile wine, it will improve with age!” he laughed.

While Jim Murphy’s has always offered a delivery service with a van on the road five days a week since the early days of their 40 years in business, it recently reduced the minimum order for free drop-offs.

“We are now offering contact-less delivery and have reduced our minimum order from 12 to six bottles to make the delivery service more accessible—and safe, given the current climate,” AJ said.

“I love a beer at the pub or a good wine with a meal in a restaurant so if we are told to stay at home, I couldn’t imagine getting through that without some good bottles.”

He noted that the store normally delivered 9 am-6 pm Monday-Friday but are happy to do weekends upon request. Most of the stock could be perused online, except the beer range.

“But making recommendations is our strength and we will be able to do this over the phone or email, whatever is easier for our customers.”

Meanwhile, for those who still want to browse the shelves for that stand-out bottle, AJ said all stores are regularly sanitising all counters, fridge doors, trolleys, shopping baskets, EFTPOS machines…basically anything customers or staff touch. Staff are washing hands often and maintaining safe distances where possible.

He hoped the delivery service would be a benefit to many.

“More than anything we want our existing regular customers to use our delivery service if they need it. As an independent we give people the option to shop local whilst being highly competitive with the multi-nationals. We have many friends in business here in Canberra. Liquor store owners, restaurateurs and shop owners.

“I hope the Canberra community engages the regular places they visit, and gets in touch to see what services might still be available. Shop local, even if it is not with us. We are all in this together.”

How’s a free bottle of wine sound?

Jim Murphy’s is offering a free bottle of Schobers ‘Needle In a Haystack’ Shiraz to HerCanberra readers with any online order. Simply enter ‘Her Canberra’ in the delivery comments, or mention it if you place your order by phone or email.

On Friday we took drastic steps to ensure that you could mark the end of a crazy COVID19 week in suitable style, with an alcoholic drink (aptly named The Quarantini) in hand.

We (and by we I mean I, Emma Macdonald, Associate Editor of HerCanberra and Phillip Jones, The Martini Whisperer) joined forces to bring you 30 minutes of scintillating cocktail making and conversation via an Instagram live.

We amassed an audience well in excess of the former 500 limit on large groups but managed to do so while maintaining appropriate social distancing—i.e., everyone was at home sitting on their sofas in tracksuits with several bottles of plonk in front of them.

We believe this was a win-win for keeping community connections during these uncertain times, and for us, at least, it was a hoot.

Thank you to those who watched along, and here is the global debut of the recipe of The Martini Whisperer’s special bespoke Quarantini—invented especially for HerCanberra.

I can attest it was bloody magnificent and will be gathering the ingredients this week to continue the tradition in my own home (remember bottle shops are an essential service and will be open—phew!)

The Martini Whisperer’s Quarantini

What you need

15ml Maidenii Nocturne Vin Amer

60ml Underground Spirits Chilli Citrus Vodka

1/4 teaspoon Silver or Gold Edible Dust

What to do

Add to cocktail shaker with ice and shake for 30 seconds.

Pour into a chilled cocktail glass and garnish with a lemon twist.

A few notes

Now friends, we totally understand that you may not have access to these exact ingredients, so Phillip advises you can use these as alternate ingredients:

Regular vodka with a dash of Tabasco into the cocktail shaker

Dry Vermouth with a dash of bitters

He sourced the silver edible dust from The Essential Ingredient in Kingston which is operating an online store. So one click of the mouse and you will be able to go the full Monty next time you want to run cocktail hour in your own home. Sometimes life calls for a little silver sparkle, and we reckon now is one of those times.

For hygiene purposes, we recommend taking a spray and wipe solution and cleaning cloths or sanitising wipes with you, to make sure equipment is as clean as possible—before and after use.

With health advice stressing the importance of getting fresh air and exercise (always at a safe distance from others), here are our favourite places to break a sweat—for free—outdoors in Canberra.

Not to mention that with social-distancing the new norm, the outdoor fitness equipment can give us the privacy and space we need to stay active during this time.

The crisp crunch of leaves underfoot and the kaleidoscope of colourful trees means that autumn is gorgeous outdoors—provided you stay 1.5 metres from others and practice good hygiene.

DEAKIN FITNESS STATION

If you live or work near Deakin, Deakin Fitness Station is a great facility to add in to your fitness routine. It’s right near parkland and walking trails, so it’s easy to add in some strength work mid-run or work, or even to make a bit of a circuit.

Do a few sets of bodyweight exercises and then go for a short run; then repeat. There are handy boards showing you how to use the equipment just nearby, and some good stretch instructions, too.

GLEBE PARK

Glebe Park is a great option for those looking for an outdoor lunchtime workout—most days you’ll see packs of joggers making their way through its leafy environs, and small bootcamps doing their thing.

But it’s easy to make your own workout here—you can walk or run its trails, do some shuttle runs, some walking lunges, grab a park bench for some modified press-ups—there are heaps of options!

Oh, and it’s great if you’ve got kids—they can play on the equipment while you work out nearby…

WESTON FITNESS STATION

Weston Fitness Station is a beauty – it’s a little tucked away (which is good if you suffer from performance anxiety) but right near other recreation facilities in Dillon Close neighbourhood park.

This station has equipment for one of my favourite exercises—the corkscrew—this may be because it’s the closest you get to dance in a fitness circuit! It’s a great way to work your abs, bum and thighs…and it’s fun!

You’ll also find lots of other equipment nearby, so the rest of your body can join the party.

KAMBAH FITNESS STATION

Kambah Fitness Station is a compact facility, well kitted out with modern equipment like a chin-up bar (don’t freak out—you can do jump chins if you can’t quite get the full movement), a sit-up bench and horizontal bars.

These pieces of equipment may sound basic, but they lend themselves to a whole array of exercises.

LAKESIDE AT YARRALUMLA

The facilities here at Yarralumla aren’t fancy and new, but they’re perfect for adding some strength work into your run or walk—or stretching out afterwards.

It’s just a stunning spot, looking out over Lake Burley Griffin, and Autumn is the perfect time to enjoy it.

JOHN KNIGHT MEMORIAL PARK

Make sure you slide down the slippery slides here, they’re heaps of fun!

That’s probably the best thing about John Knight Memorial Park in Belconnen—it has some great dedicated fitness facilities, like bars and benches, but there are oodles of things to occupy the kids just nearby.

There’s also a big open space for running, groundwork, and whatever else you choose to do. Oh, and there’s a lake view here, too. Nice.

FADDEN PINES

Fadden Pines is another great spot for exercising if you’ve got the kids with you. What an amazing facility! Heaps of fitness options and just an all-round beautiful park.

Even though it’s not in our neighbourhood, I’ve made this a regular jaunt for the kids and me.

CRACE RECREATION PARK

Crace Recreation Park is almost enough to make me want to move northside. It’s amazing! Just like an outdoor gym…

You’ll find pretty much all the ‘fixed weight’ equipment you’d find in a standard gym here, but it’s outside, free and accessible to anyone.

You could easily DIY a strength training circuit here a few times per week, mix it up with some walking/running/walking on the other days, and that’s you sorted. I want one near me, please.

CHIFLEY FITNESS STATION

I decided to round out this article with Chifley Fitness Station for a few reasons. Firstly, because it has a great range of activities – from balance beams to parallel bars and more.

Plus it’s just near a great big oval and a cracker of a park (and there’s really good coffee just nearby!)

Podcasts are nothing new, but in the age of COVID-19 where some of us are seeking ALL THE INFORMATION or, alternatively, some non-apocalyptic breathing space, podcasts can help.

Podcasts are also a great way for older relatives who may be isolated to discover new media to enjoy.

While podcasts may be “Um, duh” to you and me, many of my older relatives and friends find the various podcast apps a bit confusing. Perhaps now is the time for us to help out with that.

As HerCanberra’s resident podcast junkie, I’ve put together a list for those seeking more—or less—information about COVID-19. No judgement here as to which a side of the spectrum you fall on.

PODCASTS ABOUT COVID-19

I might add that I wouldn’t recommend listening to all of these at once. Our world is in a state of chaos and flux but we do have the choice to unplug, switch off and reset—even just for a couple of hours.

GLOBAL NEWS PODCAST + CORONAVIRUS GLOBAL UPDATE (BBC)

I love the BBC GLOBAL NEWS PODCAST. With two released daily, international news is delivered in a straightforward “6 o’clock news”-style broadcast, with reports from around the world.

With each story, the host chats with a BBC journalist on the ground where the action is happening, bringing a real sense of timeliness and authenticity to each news piece. There are also good news stories too!

While much of the news is about COVID-19 anyway, the BBC has also created a daily CORONAVIRUS GLOBAL UPDATE podcast which is a short and snappy update with stories and statistics.

If you’re limiting your news intake as much as possible, the CORONAVIRUS GLOBAL UPDATE might be the perfect podcast for you.

CORONACAST (ABC RADIO)

As the name might suggest, this is ABC’ Radio’s own COVID-19 podcast.

In manageable 9-12 minute doses, the premise of CORONACAST is simple—ABC Health Reporter Tegan Taylor and physician and journalist Dr Norman Swan discuss the day’s COVID-19 developments and answer listener questions each week day.

A great one to listen to for an Australian-focus, and with the added bonus of an expert medical opinion.

THE SQUIZ

A staple of the HerCanberra team, THE SQUIZ is your ultimate wrap of what you need to know, daily.

Released each weekday morning at 6 am, Aussie journos Clare Kimball and Larissa Moore serve you the headlines you need to know—now.

With each podcast no more than 10 minutes, The Squiz is a great way to get across the news fast with an Australian focus.

THE DAILY (NEW YORK TIMES)

A great resource if you’d like to know more about the American response to COVID-19, THE DAILY is the New York Times politics and events podcast.

Hosted by podcast icon, Michael Barbaro, THE DAILY’s COVID-19 coverage has been exceptional long-before it became a pandemic.

7AM (SCHWARTZ MEDIA)

Schwartz Media also produces The Monthly and The Saturday Paper, so 7AM’s daily format usually revolves around interviewing one of their journalists about a subject in-depth, much like The Daily.

However, since COVID-19 reached Australia, the content has been focused on the political and national response to the crisis.

PODCASTS ABOUT ANYTHING BUT COVID-19

Here’s a random assortment of some of my and the HerCanberra team’s favourite podcasts. Download, switch off and enjoy.

Obviously more recent episodes of these shows might contain COVID-19 content, but for the most part you’ll find coronavirus-free content bliss.

MY DAD WROTE A PORNO

The ultimate feel-good podcast. Just try and stop yourself from laughing out loud.

What happens when you find out your retiree dad has written a B-grade romance novel? You read it out loud with your two best mates, of course. The result is side-splittingly funny and if you don’t believe me, just ask the show’s worldwide following…

Needless to say this isn’t one if there are little ears around.

THE HIGH LOW

Intelligent banter between two London-based writers—Dolly Alderton and Pandora Sykes. The name comes from the show’s unique mix of high and low culture content, think: a discussion about Love Island one minute and Brexit the next.

A bonus is that the show is currently on ‘maternity leave’, so its 2019 content is completely coronavirus-free!

THE REWATCHABLES

Insightful and hilarious discussion of classic films with a panel of ‘experts’. Essentially: ‘Here’s why you need to rewatch this…’

CASEFILE

Only true crime lovers need apply because that’s all you’ll find here. Expect well-researched episodes about famous cases—such as the Yorkshire Ripper—as well as coverage of modern crimes. Warning: some of the content can be very graphic.

CONVERSATIONS

ABC Radio’s iconic talk show features fascinating people from across Australia in conversation with insightful ABC journos.

ARMCHAIR EXPERT WITH DAX SHEPARD

Celebrity interviews get back to basics as actor Dax Shepard chats with Hollywood’s best and brightest.

Dax is neither journalist nor gossip columnist and the result is refreshingly entertaining and insightful.

AND IF YOU’RE HAVING A TOUGH TIME COPING…

When I feel anxious, overwhelmed or sleepless, I love the HEADSPACE app.

It’s free to download and there’s plenty of free content to explore, although to access the entire library of content you do have to pay a subscription fee.

The short breathing exercises can be a godsend in times of stress and I personally find the Sleepcasts (yes, sleep podcasts with stories) really relaxing for bedtime.

If you need a bit more support and would like to chat with someone, call Lifeline on 13 11 14.","GLOBAL NEWS PODCAST + CORONAVIRUS GLOBAL UPDATE (BBC)I love the BBC GLOBAL NEWS PODCAST.

https://hercanberra.com.au/cpstyle/apartments-benefits-house-meet-ginninderrys-flexi-living/,Apartments with the benefits of a house: Meet Ginninderry’s Flexi-living,2020-03-22 21:20:34+11,1584912034,"Beatrice Smith

Meet Ginninderry’s Flexi-Living—the ownership of a house for the price and footprint of a townhouse.

When it comes to property, it’s easy to feel a bit like Goldilocks. Too small, too big, too expensive, too taxing to the environment. It seems like every house has a little something missing.

For many Millennials looking to purchase their first property, an apartment or townhouse seems like a sensible, sustainable option—a smaller footprint for the environment and a smaller price point in what’s getting to be an overwhelmingly expensive market. Win-win.

But apartments and townhouses come with some baggage too—namely body corporate fees and shared land titles—not to mention restrictions when it comes to renovations. For those looking to live small in the long term, flexibility is needed.

For Ginninderry, one of Canberra’s newest communities whose focus is squarely on sustainable living, this ‘missing middle’ presented a unique opportunity to create a suite of homes that not only encompassed budget concerns, but also concerns about environmental impact.

The result? Ginninderry’s Flexi-Living Series. Aimed at nailing this ‘Goldilocks quotient’ of not too much, not too little, Flexi-Living offers architect-designed homes with a mix-and-match of all the best bits of townhouses (layout, spaciousness), apartments (panoramic covered balconies and intelligent space-saving design) and a house (backyards, separate titles and no strata fees).

Not to mention they’re in the heart of a community that’s based on sustainable, environmentally-friendly living at the edge of one of Canberra’s most picturesque outlooks, the Brindabellas.

With a range of 2-3 bedroom designs priced from just $398,000, Flexi-Living suits single occupants, housemates, couples and young families. But don’t take our word for it. You can try Flexi-Living out for yourself.

As part of Ginninderry’s commitment to living sustainably, they want you to not only explore their Flexi-Living display homes but get comfortable—very comfortable.

In a unique new home experience, Ginninderry has opened one of its Flexi-Living homes (a Mews Plus) as an AirBnB, meaning you can stay for a night or two in what could be your new home and try it out for size in real-time.

Available to book on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, the AirBnB provides a novel, hands-on alternative to a traditional Open Home—fitting for a community who does things differently.

Last week, the HerCanberra team did just that. Armed with a grazing platter and gourmet pizzas, we rolled up to the Mews Plus AirBnB and had a dinner party on the terrace as the sun set over the Brindabellas. The evening was clear, the sunset divine and the peace and quiet something to be treasured in this hectic time.

For someone aiming to become a first home buyer within the next year or so, it was a unique opportunity to really get a feel for what life could be like living in Ginninderry. The answer: pretty darn good.

In the wake of the crisis we have been alerted to many acts of kindness and resilience. Social distancing, in this instance has brought the industry closer together. No Biggie is a ready-to-eat food service created to start a movement in the hospitality industry.

It runs on dark kitchens, and aims to keep hospitality workers employed while keeping Canberra fed with a feeling of food security.

No Biggie is a hyperlocal effort to keep the hospitality alive in unity while supporting the local community during this time of crisis. The meal service exists to provide a level of industry certainty in an uncertain time.

The meals, which can be conveniently heated or frozen for later use, are launching at $10 to ensure that local residents have access to optimal nutrition. No Biggie Meals aim to reduce the wastage Canberra kitchens are facing and take some pressure off supermarkets and those unable to shop instore.

The initiative has been created and coordinated The Mark Agency in response to the hospitality industry’s suffering.

No Biggie Meals are available for pre order from Thursday 26 March.

A number of local hospitality businesses have banded, and invite all interested venues to collaborate on the No Biggie Meals movement. Current venues supporting the initiative include Walt & Burley, Assembly, Monster & The Duxton.

In conjunction to scrubbing your hands often, getting more sleep, moving more (outdoors or in-home workouts) we got some tips on how to supplement – we know the supp wall can be intimating if you don’t know what you’re looking for! First and foremost is hygiene and diet, though if you are looking to boost your immune system here’s what they said:

Add Vitamin C & D

Vitamin C is probably better known and more widely used than any other supplement. Not only does it help support a healthy immune system, but it may also minimise the duration of cold symptoms if you do catch one. A review of six studies found vitamin C reduced cold incidence by 50 percent. Plus, it assists the absorption of iron, which is critical to immune health. One gram of vitamin C daily is a good dose to consider, used in conjunction with zinc. Low zinc status may increase susceptibility to viruses. Vitamin D is probably less well known but a recent study of 19,000 people showed those with low levels of vitamin D suffered more colds and flu. 2,000IU of vitamin D3 daily is our suggestion to help maintain a healthy immune system. You can also boost your levels with a 20-minute stint in the sun outside danger hours each day.

Take a probiotic

Besides keeping your gut in good health, probiotics can also help your immunity. Recent research has shown probiotics are helpful for strengthening the immune system and supplementing or consuming probiotic-rich foods is a useful strategy for maintaining a healthy immune system. Harvard Medical School found that intestinal bacteria bolster the immune system by feeding T-cells. With 70 percent of our immune system in our gut flora it flourishes with supplements such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium.

Go herbal

Immune formula products can also be a good option as they contain a number of immune-supporting herbs such as andrographis, echinacea, astragalus, olive leaf and tulsi.

Garlic has been used for centuries for its anti-viral and anti-fungal benefits. Research also confirms that it helps support a healthy immune system. If you’re not a fan of fresh garlic, take a supplement of aged garlic extract.","Not only does it help support a healthy immune system, but it may also minimise the duration of cold symptoms if you do catch one.

Having visited the French Bistro numerous times over the 4-years it served in Braddon, the menu was one that vexed me. I was guilty of repeat ordering the same dish on each visit.

The story was similar for many others I had asked about their own experiences at Les Bistronomes. The general consensus was a restaurant held in high regard, though, they had only explored the two iconic menu items Duck à L’ Orange and Beef Wellington.

This time around, I was determined to venture into the new Autumn menu. The first sign of rainfall saw mushrooms and venison enter the menu as well as chestnut soup and my willingness to leave my dining experience in the hands of Chef Clėment Chauvin.

What first caught my attention is how the talented chef always has his hands in the salt and pepper. By that, I mean, he is very hands on in his own restaurant even after building a strong following. From picking up a napkin off the ground, serving a meal to a table and cooking up a storm in the kitchen, I marvelled at how involved Clėment was in his own restaurant – front and back of house. He was everywhere, and he brought great knowledge and energy to the evening.

We began the night on French classics. It seemed fitting to start on Duck Liver Parfait and Burgundy imported snails to get us into the Gallic spirit and so we looked exotic on our Instagram story. The snails were coated in a delicious garlic and parsley butter, while the parfait was super sweet from the pickled cherry topping and exceptionally creamy. In true French style we had house baked brioche and smoked tomato butter which had an inviting cream cheese texture to it. Generally, if the bread and butter is a striking start to the evening, you can bet the remainder of your night will be remarkable.","Headed to the new Les Bistronomes which now resides in Campbell, we knew we were in for an evening of haute cuisine.

Or do you prefer a heart-pumping hike? Us Canberrans are lucky enough to be surrounded by beautiful bushland which offer all sorts of walking trails to explore.

Getting outside and walking in nature is something I love and is a big part of my life. Here are my personal favourites that our bush capital has to offer:

Baby + Child Friendly

The National Arboretum

The walking tracks that surround the spectacular National Arboretum are perfect for a mother’s group or leisurely stroll with the pram. They have plenty of options depending on whether you want to take a 25-minute walk, or have the space in your day for an hour or two. They have up to seven trails to choose from. Whatever you decide, this map will guide you through the many native trees, which the kids can tick off the list as they find them. Not only is this a beautiful setting to get some fresh air, but you’re bound to leave with some tree knowledge! You can finish off with a cuppa at the Sprout Café and the impressive Pod Playground.

Botanic Gardens

Located at the base of Black Mountain, the iconic Botanic Gardens have many walking trails to choose from. Explore the misty rainforest area, the Flower To Tower walk which takes you from the gardens to Black Mountain Tower, the Bushland Nature walk or the Who Did That? children’s trail, which offers activity stations to introduce children to the concept that plants are important for animal biodiversity. Alternatively, you can follow the main path around the gardens which is just as enjoyable. If you work up an appetite, stop in at Pollen Café for a bite to eat.

Lake Burley Griffin

This nice flat walk is suitable for prams, and you can choose to go as far as you like. Showing off some of the most well-known buildings of Canberra, this walking trail hugs Lake Burley Griffin so you get a water view the whole way! If you’re new to Canberra or visiting, you might like to try a self-guided tour and explore up to 34 points of interest. If you’re up for a big walk you can do the whole circuit, it’s a big lake! This will take you around 1.5-2 hours. For a shorter option, do the bridge-to-bridge, which takes you from Kings Avenue Bridge to Commonwealth Bridge.

You will find a number of little cafes, food vans and playgrounds along the way for the little ones to take a break.

Lake Tuggeranong

If you’re on the Southside and fancy a water view, Lake Tuggeranong offers a cruisy 6.7km loop. If you’re on a mission without the kids or you have a baby sleeping in the pram, you could easily do it in an hour. If the little one’s tagging along, it may take longer. Halfway you can stop in at the Learn to Ride Centre, located between Mortimer Lewis Drive and Lake Tuggeranong. It’s perfect if your children are learning to ride anything with wheels, and it’s nearby Mimi’s Pit Stop, a cute coffee van open on weekends.","Us Canberrans are lucky enough to be surrounded by beautiful bushland which offer all sorts of walking trails to explore.

The concert centred on the theme of the healing power of music, an incredibly relevant subject given recent events.

The evening featured the world premiere of Ella Macens’ Superimposition and works commissioned by The Hush Foundation.

The combination of quiet pizzicato and col legno underneath the main melody of these pieces conveyed an undeniable, but still palatable, sense of tension and unrest that resolved satisfactorily at the end of the piece.","Last Thursday, a rich sunset and sound cocooned the Gordon Darling Hall of the National Portrait Gallery as the Canberra Symphony Orchestra presented the first concert of their 2020 Australian Series.

Desperate times call for desperate measures, and as Bear Grylls said on Twitter “Improve, adapt, overcome”. Here are some methods to keep the housebound jitters away!

Online shopping is nothing new but with the current precautions it is recommended more than usual. ASOS, Urban Outfitters and The Iconic are great examples for all your Internet window shopping needs that offer your favourite brands. If you’re a current student and sign up to UniDays you can receive massive discounts from said sites, including Adidas, Sephora, Cotton On, Lorna Jane and Platypus Shoes just to name a few.

Netflix has become the go to streaming service in Australia since 2015, and 50% of the adult population in Australia has an account. No wonder that is the case with its plethora of entertainment choices. Recent additions include Stranger Things season 3, John Wick 3: Parabellum, Riverdale season 4, Marriage Story, Peaky Blinders season 5 and The Irishman. Plans are from $13.99.

Foxtel has been an Australian favourite for over 15 years, currently featuring TV shows such as Game of Thrones, The Crown, The Walking Dead and Westworld, and current movies like Rocketman, Spider-Man: Farm from Home, Yesterday and Joker. Twelve-month Foxtel plans are from $49.

Disney + is the new streaming service on the block. But don’t let that sway you as they offer a massive range of all things Disney including every Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars movie, and lots of National Geographic specials who like their entertainment with a side of education. Plans start at $8.99.

Ten years ago, did any of us think that alcohol could be delivered to our front doors? Flying cars seemed more plausible, but luckily with businesses like Dan Murphy’s and Jimmy Brings delivery services within 30 minutes of ordering. Whether that’s a pinot noir, Kahlua, a Japanese whiskey or just a case of beer… Who said self-isolation was boring?

Though Woolworths have suspended their delivery options until further notice due to a significant shortage of miscellaneous stock, Coles is struggling with online deliveries so much so they have expanded to UberEats. Though each food delivery service is different from location to location UberEats, Menulog and Deliveroo are all connected to various favourite franchises such as Zambrero, Subway, Rashays, Ben & Jerry’s, Roll’d, Schnitz, Spit Shack all over Canberra so you’re never short of options!

Though the world might seem to be at a standstill our need for entertainment and nourishment continues; one app at a time.","The nation has been advised to remain indoors and avoid all social interactions unless necessary; this includes travelling domestically and internationally.

Healing Foundation Board Chair Professor Steve Larkin encouraged all jurisdictions to work closely with Stolen Generations survivors on appropriate redress outcomes, particularly as all Stolen Generations survivors move into aged care by 2023.

“This is a much needed redress for Victoria’s Stolen Generations survivors who suffered profound childhood trauma when they were forcibly removed from their homes, isolated from family and culture and often institutionalised, abused and assaulted,” Professor Larkin said.

“It is my hope that this redress will improve the social and economic disadvantage suffered by our ageing Stolen Generations survivors, many of who rely on welfare payments and live with a disability or a chronic health condition.

“It’s too late for many of the Stolen Generations who died young because of the poor health and welfare issues. We need to get on with this redress now and start to address the specific needs of an aging population, as well as fix the legacy of social and economic disadvantage.”

Recent analysis commissioned by The Healing Foundation and based on data collected by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and the Australian Bureau of Statistics has uncovered a comprehensive evidence base to illustrate the direct link between the forced removal of thousands of Victorian children from their families and the real life symptoms of intergenerational trauma.

The Healing Foundation Stolen Generations Reference Group Chair and Stolen Generations survivor Ian Hamm said Victoria has the third highest reported rate of removal and 9 per cent of Victoria’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population aged 50 and over were removed from their families.

“The Victorian Government’s commencement of a redress scheme is a good beginning to a just redress outcome, but only a start,” he said.

“Estimated to be more than 1,300 survivors, the Victorian stolen children community as a whole, look forward to working with the government on what shape the scheme finally takes.”

More than one third of Victoria’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population are descendants of the Stolen Generations.

Rani Wallace and her family are going on a bear hunt through Queanbeyan. They're gonna catch a big one! It's a beautiful day, and they're not scared, either of bears or the bug. This morning, they walked through the suburbs, spotting teddy bears in windows, their arms up as if waving; banana yellow Minions on rooftops; and pop-eyed Pig the Pug with his storybook. ""They loved it,"" Rani said. ""We ended up walking 4.8 km; they wanted to keep going for more, where usually we walk down the street, and they ask: Can we go home now? But because we were searching for the bears, and they were excited, we kept going and going."" For young families like Rani's, boredom may be one of the biggest challenges of the COVID-19 lockdown. Her three boys are all under eight - and, Rani said, they're going a little bit crazy. ""They're not enjoying it at all! But activities like this help."" Inspired by Michael Rosen's classic picture book, London householders began putting stuffed toys in windows this week to entertain bored kids. From there, the idea spread to the USA, New Zealand, and here. Rani runs the Queanbeyan Christmas Light Trail page on Facebook; she loved the idea and shared it with the community. A dozen houses in town have already taken part. ""It's a great idea to get the kids out and about exercising while maintaining that social distancing,"" Rani said. ""It occupies the kids for a good hour and a half; now it's lunchtime, and the morning's eaten up. ""It's great exercise. I'm really into fitness, and I like to keep my kids active. When we're out looking for teddy bears, they didn't even know they were exercising. You can make a game of it; we were singing, and the three-year old was counting - putting a bit of education into it as well!"" Rani and her family have two stuffed toys at the front of their home: a giant teddy bear in the window, wearing an Easter hat the boys made (the school's parade was cancelled), and a big Easter bunny on the door. To give a sense of normality, Rani tries to maintain a school routine. ""P.E. for us is obviously our bear hunt,"" she said. ""We're going to sit down and make an Easter story later on for English. Our idea was to photocopy our storybook and drop it off into the mailboxes of old people's homes. We're going to do school stuff, but involve the community as well."" If you want to put a teddy bear in your window, let Rani know through https://www.facebook.com/Queanbeyanchristmas.

The announcement follows recent tests which were verified in the last 24 hours,"" a Southern NSW Local Health District spokesperson said. Three cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in Goulburn and a total of 139 tests have been conducted. Southern NSW Local Health District Public Health Unit is in contact with each confirmed case and their close contacts, advising them to self-isolate for 14 days from when they were last with the confirmed case. They have also been advised to seek medical attention should they experience symptoms. ""Identifying close contacts ensures that those people who may be at risk take the necessary steps to avoid any further transmission,"" the spokesperson said. It is essential that everyone plays a part in containing the spread of COVID-19 by practising good hygiene measures including: Southern NSW Local Health District has established COVID-19 assessment centres throughout the district, so those with symptoms may be tested and treated quickly. The purpose of these clinics is for people who have respiratory symptoms or fever and who are at risk of COVID-19, for example because they were in contact with a COVID-19 case, or have returned from overseas in the 14 days before onset of symptoms. Any one heading to an assessment centre MUST call the SNSWLHD Central Intake Service - 1800 999 880 (option 1) before attending. You will only be tested if you fit the COVID-19 testing criteria. This testing can take up to two days to complete and report back.

http://www.queanbeyanagechronicle.com.au/story/6695287/authorities-working-to-double-nations-ventilator-numbers/?src=rss,Authorities working to double nation's ventilator numbers,2020-03-24 08:30:00+11,1585038600,"coronavirus, coronavirus, ventilators, test kits, res med

Australia is building towards about 10,000 ventilators for intensive care in the coronavirus crisis, a significant boost on the standing capacity in intensive care units around the country of about 2300. The Australia and New Zealand Intensive Care Society surveyed capacity across the country on March 7, when the nation's 191 intensive care units had 2300 intensive care beds with ventilators, president Anthony Holley said. Hospitals had the capacity to boost numbers by about 500 very quickly. And they could ramp up to about 5000 by harnessing ventilators used in other areas of hospitals, including operating theatres, and by setting up intensive care in coronary care spaces, post-operative areas, and unfunded or decommissioned areas, and would require staff and other equipment. ""If we surge beyond 100 per cent it could be challenging at the current time,"" Dr Holley said. ""But there are an enormous number of strategies to get more ventilators and we as a society feel confident that the government is doing absolutely everything it can to get those ventilators."" Health Minister Greg Hunt said Chief Scientist Alan Finkel was working to source new Australian-made ventilators, which Mr Hunt said could add 5000 more ""invasive and non-invasive respiratory and ventilator units"". READ MORE: Parliament was told this week that an order had been with Melbourne firm ResMed for 1000 invasive ventilators, and four firms had stepped in to help with producing ""non-invasive"" ventilators - ResMed, GE, Philips and Medtronic. Invasive ventilation is where patients are intubated, with the machine breathing for them. In non-invasive ventilation, breathing is boosted using a mask without tubes. Dr Holley said the society did not recommend non-invasive ventilation, but there were non-invasive machines that could be repurposed. Some of the ventilators on order were ""not necessarily top of the range ventilators but devices that will do the job"". Modelling suggested numbers should be sufficient, but it was crucial to blunt the infection peak, he said. ""I don't think we should be complacent and I don't think we are. We have advised the government that we have surge capacity of 5000 beds plus, and we've got a small deficit of ventilators at the moment,"" he said. ""It's about decreasing the requirement for critical care and taking all of the responsible measures to prevent the infection spreading at a rate that prompts a surge that potentially swamps the system."" Australian Medical Association vice president Dr Chris Zappala said COVID-19 patients who needed ventilation typically spent about two weeks on the machine. Asked whether the number of ventilators in hospitals and on order were likely to be sufficient, Dr Zappala said, ""The honest answer is that we jolly well hope that that's enough because if it's not enough then clearly we have had a significant burden of critically ill people who need assistance for their breathing."" But he said the numbers were an educated guess. ""We're trying to predict as best as we can with imperfect information what our needs might be if we have a significant proportion of patients affected and some of those need assisted breathing,"" he said. ""No one really knows. We're just trying to extrapolate from experience overseas and come up with a number."" A ResMed spokesman said the firm was looking to double or triple the output of ventilators as quickly as possible, and scale up ventilation mask production more than tenfold. Mr Hunt said another 63,000 test kits had arrived in Australia on Tuesday, adding to the 97,000 last week. About 37,000 more were on the way. In addition, Australia had ordered 1.5 million ""point of care tests"", he said. Also known as ""fingerprint tests"", they would allow more testing of people in GP practices.

The Australia and New Zealand Intensive Care Society surveyed capacity across the country on March 7, when the nation's 191 intensive care units had 2300 intensive care beds with ventilators, president Anthony Holley said.
Health Minister Greg Hunt said Chief Scientist Alan Finkel was working to source new Australian-made ventilators, which Mr Hunt said could add 5000 more ""invasive and non-invasive respiratory and ventilator units"".
In non-invasive ventilation, breathing is boosted using a mask without tubes.
Dr Holley said the society did not recommend non-invasive ventilation, but there were non-invasive machines that could be repurposed.","['ventilators', 'dr', 'units', 'source', 'breathing', 'capacity', 'authorities', 'care', 'ventilation', 'additional', '5000', 'noninvasive', 'intensive', 'working', 'coronavirus', 'health']","With the ability to ventilate about 5000 people in intensive care currently, authorities are working to source 5000 more machines.",['Kirsten Lawson']

While some shoppers have faced shelves devoid of the staple, the egg industry is assuring customers this is a short-term problem and Australia's laying hens are still hard at work. Australian Eggs managing director Rowan McMonnies said the absence of eggs in supermarkets is driven by higher than normal demand, and is not a refection of the continuity of supply.

When someone who was in the World Trade Centre on that fateful September 11 says he's scared, it stops you. So when Steve Evans says he's scared, he means really scared. Given the nation's afternoon COVID update from authorities it's reasonable to say Steve Evans, a journalist at The Canberra Times, is indeed Everyman. Except he's in hardcore self-isolation having returned from overseas not too long ago. The nation's eighth fatality, a woman in her 70s, was a passenger on the Ruby Princess cruise ship. It's important to remember however, not everyone who has travelled overseas recently has COVID-19. More positive tests were returned by travellers in Canberra and on the NSW Mid-North Coast today, while in the NSW Central West notification of someone who has tested positive flying domestically was revealed. All this is reason enough Tasmanian doctors reckon for enforced hotel quarantine for all interstate travellers to the southern isle. It was one of three measures they shared in an open letter to Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein. More than half of coronavirus cases in Australia are among people aged 25 to 54, data shows. Men outnumber women among those infected, but not to the extent that has shown up in countries like China, where smoking rates among men have been posited as one reason for their higher rates of disease. The immune-suppressed have long been identified as a group under significant stress during this pandemic. We started with one of our own, so that's where we'll end. Experienced ACM journalist Louise Nichols wrote: ""I can joke that 'hey, nothing like giving someone a challenge, first cancer then a pandemic' but like everyone I am hoping to survive and grow older with my family. ""To all those people who have been laid off, closed their businesses or are simply in limbo about their future we know that it is a very difficult time for you. I don't know many local families who have not been affected in someway. Take care everyone, and please, stay home and wash your hands."" Did you know you can receive this digest twice a day by email.

Council has written to the Minister for Planning stating that ""the time has come for the ACT Government to take decisive action to resolve what threatens to become one of the greatest planning blunders since the advent of self-government."" Read the full letter on our website and if you agree then write to the Minister. Koko in Wright: ACTPLA have approved the revised plans for the Koko development in Wright. There are a number of conditions to be worked through by the developer but it is light on a supermarket for Wright and Coombs. Health: With the spread of the Covid-19 virus in Australia please listen to the guidance being given by our Health experts. We all need to remain calm and work together through this crisis. The Weston Creek Walk-in-Health Centre is currently the place to assess possible cases. Parking proposal at Cooleman Court: Council remains waiting for further discussions with officials from TCCS about what is to be finally proposed for the site off Parkinson Street.

Hooning: Council has received replies from the Minister for Police and the Minister for Road Safety in relation to ""hooning"" on our local roads. These are on our website but do not really bring any confidence that there will be any change to the current situation.

""I think the koalas have been a bit forgotten about in light of what's happened so it's good to talk about them. ""There's still a long way to go for some but we've handed a lot over to other carers and many of these have been released.""

The Federal Government has released the second stage of its economic plan to cushion the economic impact of the coronavirus and to help recovery. READ ALSO: Six COVID-19 cases confirmed in health district A total of $189 billion is being injected into the economy to keep Australians in work and businesses in business, including in the Hume electorate. This includes $17.6 billion for the first economic stimulus package, $90 billion from the RBA and $15 billion from the government to deliver easier access to finance, and $66.1 billion in today's economic support package. The economic support package includes: Prime minister Scott Morrison said the government was acting to cushion the blow from the coronavirus for businesses and households to help them get through to the other side of the crisis. CHECK OUT: Goulburn Mulwaree Council closes facilities due to COVID-19 restrictions ""We want to help businesses keep going as best they can and for as long as they can, or to pause instead of winding up their business. We want to ensure that when this crisis has passed Australian businesses can bounce back,"" he said. ""Our focus is on cushioning the blow and providing hope to every Australian that we will get through this and come out the other side together. ""We know this will be temporary. That's why all our actions are geared towards building a bridge, keeping more people in work, enhancing the safety net for those that aren't and keeping businesses alive so they can get to the other side and stand up their workforce as quickly as possible. ""We know Australia's more than 3 million small and medium businesses are the engine room of our economy. When they hurt, we all hurt. ""The next few months are going to be a difficult journey but we all have a role to play to adapt to the changes we're facing, to cushion the impact of what is happening and to pull together so we can bounce back when we get to the other side."" Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the $189 billion economic support package was the equivalent of 9.7 per cent of GDP. ""The government is taking unprecedented action to strengthen the safety net available to Australians that are stood down or lose their jobs and increasing support for small businesses that do it tough over the next six months,"" he said. ""These measures build significantly on what we have already announced. ""These extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures."" Hume member Angus Taylor MP said this action would directly benefit the local community and support residents, workers, and small and medium businesses to bounce back. ""I have also spoken to all major energy suppliers over recent days and asked them to extend hardship policies to those affected, either directly or indirectly. They are now putting those expanded policies in place,"" he said. ""The Australian economy is resilient, and we are well placed to navigate the economic implications arising from Coronavirus."" Coronavirus supplement The government is temporarily expanding eligibility to income support payments and establishing a new, time-limited Coronavirus supplement to be paid at a rate of $550 per fortnight. This will be paid to both existing and new recipients of the JobSeeker Payment, Youth Allowance jobseeker, Parenting Payment, Farm Household Allowance and Special Benefit. The Coronavirus supplement will be paid for the next six months. Eligible income support recipients will receive the full amount of the $550 Coronavirus supplement on top of their payment each fortnight. This measure is estimated to cost $14.1 billion over the forward estimates period. An increase of up to 5000 staff for Services Australia will assist to support delivery of new government measures. Payments to support households In addition to the $750 stimulus payment announced March 12, the government will provide a further $750 payment to social security and veteran income support recipients and eligible concession card holders, except for those who are receiving an income support payment that is eligible to receive the Coronavirus supplement. This second payment will be made automatically from July 13 to around five million social security, veteran and other income support recipients and eligible concession card holders. Around half of those that benefit are pensioners. The first payment will be made from March 31 to people who will have been on one of the eligible payments any time between March 12 and April 13. This measure is estimated to cost $4 billion over the forward estimates period. Early release of superannuation The government will allow individuals in financial stress as a result of the coronavirus to access up to $10,000 of their superannuation in 2019-20 and a further $10,000 in 2020-21. Eligible individuals will be able to apply online through myGov for access of up to $10,000 of their superannuation before July 1. They will also be able to access up to a further $10,000 from July 1 for another three months. They will not need to pay tax on amounts released and the money they withdraw will not affect Centrelink or Veterans' Affairs payments. This measure is estimated to cost $1.2 billion over the forward estimates period. Temporarily reduce superannuation minimum drawdown rates The government is temporarily reducing superannuation minimum drawdown requirements for account based pensions and similar products by 50 per cent for 2019-20 and 2020-21. This measure will benefit retirees by providing them with more flexibility as to how they manage their superannuation assets. Reducing social security deeming rates On top of the deeming rate changes made at the time of the first package, the government is reducing the deeming rates by a further 0.25 percentage points to reflect the latest rate reductions by the RBA. As of May 1, the lower deeming rate will be 0.25 per cent and the upper deeming rate will be 2.25 per cent. The change will benefit around 900,000 income support recipients, including Age Pensioners. This measure is estimated to cost $876 million over the forward estimates period. Boosting Cash Flow for Employers The government is providing up to $100,000 to eligible small and medium sized businesses, and not-for-profits (including charities) that employ people, with a minimum payment of $20,000. These payments will help businesses' and not-for-profits' cash flow so they can keep operating, pay their rent, electricity and other bills and retain staff. Under the enhanced scheme from the first package, employers will receive a payment equal to 100 per cent of their salary and wages withheld (up from 50 per cent), with the maximum payment being increased from $25,000 to $50,000. In addition, the minimum payment is being increased from $2,000 to $10,000. The payment will be available from April 28. By linking the payments to business to staff wage tax withholdings, businesses will be incentivised to hold on to more of their workers. The payments are tax free, there will be no new forms and payments will flow automatically through the ATO. This measure will benefit around 690,000 businesses employing around 7.8 million people, and around 30,000 NFPs (including charities). Small and medium business entities with aggregated annual turnover under $50 million and that employ workers are eligible. NFPs entities, including charities, with aggregated annual turnover under $50 million and that employ workers will now also be eligible. This will support employment at a time where NFPs are facing increasing demand for services. An additional payment is also being made from July 28. Eligible entities will receive an additional payment equal to the total of all of the Boosting Cash Flow for Employers payments received. This measure is estimated to cost $31.9 billion over the forward estimates period, including the value of the measure announced in the first package. Regulatory protection and financial support for businesses to stay in business Coronavirus SME Guarantee Scheme The government will establish the Coronavirus SME Guarantee Scheme which will support small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to get access to working capital to help them get them through the impact of the coronavirus. Under the Scheme, the government will guarantee 50 per cent of new loans issued by eligible lenders to SMEs. The government's support will enhance lenders' willingness and ability to provide credit to SMEs with the Scheme able to support $40 billion of lending to SMEs. The scheme will complement the announcement the Government has made to cut red-tape to allow SMEs to get access to credit faster. It also complements announcements made by Australian banks to support small businesses with their existing loans. This builds on the investment the government is making to enable smaller lenders to continue supporting Australian consumers and small businesses, through providing the AOFM an investment capacity of $15 billion to invest in wholesale funding markets used by small authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADI) and non-ADI lenders. It further supports the Reserve Bank of Australia's announcement of a $90 billion term funding facility for ns ADIs, that will reduce the cost of lending, with particular incentives to lend to small and medium enterprises. The measures the government is announcing today, along with the previous announcements, will deliver a total of $125 billion to support Australians get through the impact of the coronavirus. The government will guarantee up to $20 billion to support $40 billion in SME loans. Providing temporary relief for financially distressed businesses The Government is temporarily increasing the threshold at which creditors can issue a statutory demand on a company and the time companies have to respond to statutory demands they receive. The package also includes temporary relief for directors from any personal liability for trading while insolvent. The Corporations Act 2001 will be amended to provide temporary and targeted relief for companies to deal with unforeseen events that arise as a result of the coronavirus. This builds on the support for business and business investment provided in our first economic support package, which included: Support for the aviation industry As previously announced, the government is also providing up to $715 million in support for Australian airlines and airports, which will ensure that our aviation sector receives timely cash flow support through an unprecedented period of disruption to international and domestic air travel.

One of my favourite cinema moments has nothing to do with the movie I'm watching. It is when the lights in the cinema dim imperceptibly, indicating the movie is about the start. I sink into the seat and wait for the electric shadows to appear on the screen. That serene feeling would not be possible without the inventive brilliance of Thomas Alva Edison. He gave us sound recording, motion picture cameras and the electric lightbulb. George Westinghouse, on the other hand, pioneered access to electricity for everyone. Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse are names synonymous with companies that produce washing machines, light bulbs, refrigerators, aircraft engines and street lighting. Behind Westinghouse and General Electric were people whose visions drove their inventiveness and powered their ambitions. And made our lives more comfortable. The Current War is not a reference to the calamitous situation we in Australia and the entire world find ourselves today. Current refers to the nature of electricity that powers our world and our lifestyles and the way it is delivered to our homes and businesses. It's all about direct current and alternating current. Inventor Edison (Benedict Cumberbatch) favours direct current; industrialist Westinghouse (Michael Shannon), along with futurist Nicola Tesla (Nicholas Hoult), advocates alternating current. In the 1880s, the world was lit by gas lamps and other polluting sources of energy. The world was on the verge of switching from gaslights to electric lightbulbs. Whose form of electric current will be adopted: Edison's DC or Westinghouse's AC? Success means enormous wealth, acclaim and a legacy of inventive brilliance. Edison is outwardly egotistical, willing to embark on a campaign to discredit Westinghouse by any means, and determined to triumph with his energy system. Westinghouse is calmer, more measured and determined to fight on the grounds of technical superiority. Intrigue, deception, financial backing from banker JP Morgan and support from their respective partners power the power play for dominance of the electrical grid. Our generation's equivalent of Edison, Westinghouse and Tesla are Gates, Jobs and Musk. Inventors, industrialists and futurists alter the way people live their lives. We take the mountain of inventions for granted. Gates and Jobs had a relationship in business and inventiveness that rivals the battle between Edison and Westinghouse for supremacy in the delivery of electrical power on a mass scale. It doesn't matter that you have no interest in Edison and Westinghouse's rivalry beyond knowing that the lights in your house will glow when you flick the switch. To discover the sparks behind the clashes between these industrial innovators, watch The Current Wars rather than sticking your fingers into an electric socket. It's much safer and more entertaining.

Minutes before Australia's borders closed to non-residents Etihad Airways flight EY454 landed in Sydney. These passengers were the last to arrive on Australian soil before the government enforced ban. From now only Australian citizens, permanent residents and immediate family members will be allowed in to the country. There were tears of relief as and hugs of joy as relatives anxiously greeted loved ones. UK citizen Simon Rose was delighted to make it into Sydney seven minutes before the deadline. Simon, originally from Maidenhead packed up his life in Dubai in just six hours after hearing the border was about to close. He had planned to marry his fiancée, Bushra Ali, an Australian resident in the UK in April but those plans changed at lightning speed. He heard the borders were closing at 4pm and had jumped on a plane with his life's belongings by 10pm. He said: ""I made it just in time, with seven minutes to go."" The couple now plan to spend some time planning their wedding while in self isolation. One couple had narrowly made it out of Egypt, cutting short their 26 day tour when they heard flights were stopping. They flew to Dubai and then to Sydney after days of trying to get home. ""I'm relieved to be home,"" said Milva Nagle from Sydney. ""We were on the Nile when this all started, with limited wifi. We tried to get out of Egypt but it was cancelled and eventually we got the last flight out of Egypt."" Milva and her husband, Andrew, said their tour operator Tripadeal.com had been fantastic but their 26-day trip of a lifetime had been cut by a third. Shannon Hines, 25, a nurse from Sydney said she couldn't wait to get a shower. She had cut short her two and half week holiday in London, visiting a friend, because she was worried she'd be trapped in the UK. She will now go into isolation and once she has the all clear she expects that she will soon be working taking care of patients. She said: ""I was quite anxious about the whole thing. By the day before I was due to fly London was closing down tube stations. I thought if I didn't get out by the weekend I would be trapped."" Timmy Manson, 20, nervously waited for his girlfriend, Georgie, 23. A UK citizen she was flying into Sydney from New Zealand. The couple were due to reunite in April but the sudden border closure from Australia saw her bring their plans forward and book onto the first available flight into Sydney. Timmy said: ""Since she has a UK passport I wasn't sure she'd get here. It is a massive relief."" Timmy, a ski instructor, was tested for COVID-19 two weeks ago after returning from his ski job in Japan. He'd been hoping to start the winter ski season in New Zealand but now the future is uncertain. Australia has progressively shut down its borders, banning people first from China, then Iraq, South Korea and Italy. On Sunday, it imposed a compulsory 14-day quarantine for anyone arriving in Australia, including citizens.

On this week's coronavirus-affected, studio audience-less edition of his screwy weekly news digest Mad As Hell, funnyman Shaun Micallef couldn't stand the canned laughter oh-so familiar from the corny TV comedies of yesteryear. Michael Rowland had kindly loaned ""the machine he uses to practice the jokes he does on News Breakfast"", Micallef explained as the oversized contraption chugged out lame guffaws. But Micallef quickly banished the laugh track sound effects gizmo from his ABC studio set. ""I can get by without an audience,"" he dryly deadpanned down the barrel of the camera. ""I have for most of my career."" Micallef, Q&A host Hamish Macdonald - also limited this week to a church mouse-esque studio audience studiously practicing social distancing - and our elite footballers in their vacant stadiums may well be paid professionals who can roll on without the usual, comfortingly communal, rounds of applause, cheering and laughter. But not the rest of us here at home on the couch. The Thursday night footy live on the telly just sounded wrong. Sure it looked like football with the players going through the motions. But the feeling, the atmosphere, was as empty as the stadiums. On Monday there was not nearly enough groaning and sniggering going on in Q&A's cheap seats as the same old pollie waffle ricocheted between the obligatory parliamentary adversaries. Funny how you don't miss a random cutaway shot to an eye-rolling uni student in the third row until it's gone. On Wednesday Micallef and his Mad As Hell goofballs were as absurd and as clever as usual even though at my place I could only hear one person laughing - me - when he formally apologised on behalf of the nation to Hollywood superstar Tom Hanks over that little mishap with the coronavirus diagnosis. ""It's bad enough you had to come over here to make a film with Baz Luhrmann and that you had to do it on the Gold Coast,"" Micallef winced. ""I had to go to the Logies up there last year so I know what hell that can be. Though it must be said that's mainly because it's the Logies."" So, to help you achieve your recommended weekly output of chuckles we have scrounged around social media for 19 virally themed memes. We're calling this random selection, um, the COVID-19. We think it could catch on. We hope these memes will help get you through. Well, through the next two minutes at least. Naturally, you can't talk memes thesedays without at least one featuring Baby Yoda from the Disney+ Star Wars series, The Mandalorian. Seriously, if you are self-isolating you must get on that. And, of course, toilet paper memes are spreading faster than the coronavirus. As they say, laughter can be contagious. It's apparently the best medicine too - and you don't need to line up outside Coles or Aldi to procure some. So please enjoy these memes. Applause and cheering are optional, but encouraged.

UPDATE: Despite restrictions on cafes, the Mill Cafe is still serving takeaway meals and coffee. A Queanbeyan café is serving more than coffee and lunch while the coronavirus pandemic intensifies. April and Mo Hbaika at the Mill Café and their family are helping some of the town's most vulnerable people get the food and supplies they need. ""We thought we had to do something,"" April said. ""We have a lot of older customers, families, mums. They were all saying how awful it was they couldn't source things to cook for their families. We thought this is ridiculous; we're in a position where we can help."" Through their bulk suppliers, the family was able to order 10 kg boxes of pasta, flour, and the ""precious, precious!"" toilet paper. On Facebook, they invited seniors and people with disabilities to collect the items. ""We're mimicking Coles and Woolies, I guess,"" April said, referring to the supermarkets' early morning hour dedicated for the elderly and disabled. Because some senior citizens cannot make it to the supermarkets so early, this gives them another option. The Mill Café is also selling cheap but nutritious takeaway meals: a different choice each night, including carbonara and lentil and chickpea curry so far. ""It's nothing fancy,"" April said, ""but at least they don't have to stress about going to the supermarket in the afternoon and just being frustrated."" The $5 price covers the family's costs. The idea started, April explained, because one of her good customers couldn't do her usual shop before work; by the time she finished at 6pm, there was nothing left for her family to eat. The supermarket shelves are nearly empty, April said; when she went the other day, all she found were two frozen lasagnas. ""There was nothing else,"" April said. ""This is not good. It's getting to the stage where people were trying to buy all the two-minute noodles and soup. There's really nothing left."" April said she was shocked by the amount of positive feedback their Facebook post received. It was shared more than 100 times, and received nearly 60 glowing comments. ""This melts my heart,"" said one. ""People will remember your support long after Corona is relegated to history,"" read another; ""restoring faith in humanity, one person at a time."" The takeaway meals will still be sold under the coronavirus restrictions on cafes, the Mill announced on Monday morning. And locals came in droves to give their assistance. Some donated food: small packets of cereal, long-life milk, tinned fish. One man came down with a three-pack of soap. ""Even though it doesn't seem like much, it really does help those people who don't have anything,"" April said. Others donated money so the family could buy more supplies. Those donations made up eight bags of groceries that Meals on Wheels will take out to the most vulnerable. Other Facebook users have offered to deliver some of the half kilo bags of food April and her family packaged themselves. (Meals on Wheels can only deliver prepackaged, unopened food.) April thanked the public for their generosity, and encouraged people to continue donations`- even if just cans of soup or packets of pasta. ""This is ongoing, and we will accept donations of anything that people can spare,"" she said. ""We're in a capacity to order some things, but we don't even know if we will be limited in the near future. We don't have an endless supply, and neither do our suppliers. ""We're also open to any suggestions the community has about what we can do,"" April said. The Mill Café is at 57 Collett Street, Queanbeyan, open Tuesday to Friday 7-3, weekends 7-2.

Now that in-person events have unambiguously become impossible, the internet finds itself brimming with live streams, taped sessions, and other creative activities to keep music-lovers occupied in their self-isolation.

One of the unexpected side effects of the current COVID-19 crisis is that performing artists all around the world are now engaging in the same space. It means that audiences have the choice to watch live performances from internationally renowned artists or to tune in to catch local acts, all without getting up from the couch.

There are some intriguing streams happening in internet land this week. We’ve handpicked a few locally-run events for you to check out. Scroll to the bottom for a full, up-to-date list of live streams taking place from around the world.

When: Sunday, 28 March, 5:00 pm start

How to attend: Purchase a ticket via TryBooking, then watch the stream via Facebook.

Canberra punks Glitoris lead the bill for The Cancelled Concert. The idea behind the show came in the wake of last week’s seemingly endless flow of event cancellations that left thousands of musicians without a gig. Attendees can purchase their ticket online and then tune into a private live stream. More acts are set to be announced in the coming days, and the artists themselves will be beamed to you from the live room at The Basement. Tickets start at $15 for concession, and range through to $35 for households. Check the Facebook event for more details.

When: Saturday, 27 March, time TBA

How to attend: Check the Isol-Aid page for updates.

Last weekend thousands of people tuned in to the first Isol-Aid Festival to catch live performances from the likes of Stella Donnelly, Julia Jacklin and Canberra’s own Sputnik Sweetheart. This week, the team of industry insiders running the show are taking to the streams for round two. The idea is that, at the designated performance time, you head over to the performing artist’s Instagram account where they will broadcast a live set. At the end of the set, they’ll direct you to the next account and the live stream chain continues from there. This week’s lineup is yet to be announced, but Sydney dream-pop duo EGOISM and Brisbane singer-songwriter Emily Wurramara are down to take part.

Easi Canberra co-owner Jack Wang, a Tuggeranong boy, says locally owned and developed app Easi is helping local businesses survive in the new lockdown environment.

EASI CANBERRA – MAKE LIFE EASIER – FOOD DELIVERY Want $8 free credit off your easy delivery? Share this Post or Tag a friend & Pm us for a coupon code. Download the app here.https://easi.com.au/app.html#Easicanberra #Fooddelivery #Easi #Downloadeasi #Canberra Posted by Easi Canberra Online Food Delivery Platform on Monday, 15 April 2019

“We have a wide range of local Canberra restaurants signed up,” Jack told Region Media, “and there’s been a surge in the number of restaurants signing up with us as well as increased demand from customers.

“We have your usual takeaways, but we also have a range of premium dining experiences on the app.

“We’re 10 per cent cheaper than our competitors, which means more money goes to the restaurant, which means more local businesses survive in the Canberra hospitality sector,” he said.

Easi’s online app makes ordering and payment simple for both restaurants and customers, and the delivery can be contactless. Customers can leave instructions for their delivery partners in the app for where the food should be placed for contactless delivery.

Delivery partners have been trained in contactless delivery and will set down your food order 3 metres from your door where safe or set the food down as instructed by you in the app, and call you on the contact number you designate so you can come out and receive your order. The delivery partner will stay with your food order until you are contacted, and then move away once you are ready to collect it.

This will help, says Jack, to keep all Canberrans safe, and enable restaurants to continue to trade, keeping local Canberrans in work.

“Some restaurants will have their own delivery service, but they may not be able to deliver outside a local area, or outside the ACT,” said Jack. “We can offer them the opportunity to be able to deliver all over Canberra and the surrounding region, to places near Canberra such as Queanbeyan, but they can maintain their own local deliveries to keep their staff going,” he said.

Easi can deliver to within a 50 km radius of any restaurant, meaning customers in Queanbeyan and the surrounding Canberra region can get takeaway deliveries through the app. The Easi app also offers bonuses for customers, such as $10 off for your first five orders.

To order contactless delivery through Easi, download the app from Google Play or the App Store.

Libraries ACT will close its nine branches across the territory and shut off public access to the Heritage Library from today (25 March).

If you need to access essential services through the library such as computers, printers or photocopiers, you can call ACT Libraries on 6205 9000 to arrange a booking at Woden, Dickson or Gungahlin.

Canberrans need not worry about late fees with due dates for items already on loan being extended until the end of April. Library return chutes will remain open and extensions can be done online or over the phone.

With new restrictions on public gatherings now in place, funerals have been limited to 10 mourners and social distancing regulations must be adhered to. Canberra Cemeteries will remain open at Gungahlin, Woden and Hall, as well as the Norwood Park Crematorium, while chapels and places of worship will be open on a case-by-case basis.

The Australian National Botanic Gardens has also been closed.

The Domestic Animal Services (DAS) shelter in Symonston and the Yarralumla Nursery are closed to the public; however, both will continue to be staffed to ensure that the animals and plants remain cared for.

If you are interested in re-homing a dog, you can contact Access Canberra during business hours.

DAS Rangers will continue to respond to call-outs for community safety.

The Birrigai Outdoor School is also closed to the public.

The ACT Government has said that they are still working with contractors, suppliers and industry partners to mitigate any delays in infrastructure projects over the coming months.

“This is an active and ongoing conversation, particularly in light of the social distancing requirements recently enforced,” the Government said.

“Any changes to project timeframes will be communicated with the public once known.”

https://the-riotact.com/what-does-the-new-stimulus-package-mean-for-workers-and-small-businesses/365448,What does the new stimulus package mean for workers and small businesses?,2020-03-24 23:15:27+11,1585091727,"A second economic stimulus package has been unveiled over the weekend with measures including more money for welfare recipients, payments for small and medium businesses and financial stress measures to help struggling Australians.

For the next six months, the Government will pay a $550 fortnightly supplement to people on the JobSeeker Payment, Youth Allowance JobSeeker, Parenting Payment, Farm Household Allowance and Special Benefit.

This payment will be on top of their current payment.

Two weeks ago, the Government unveiled its first stimulus package including a one-off $750 payment that will be made available to welfare recipients from 31 March. A further payment of $750 will now be available to social security and veteran income support recipients, as well as some concession cardholders who are not eligible for this coronavirus supplement.

Small and medium businesses and some not-for-profits will be able to apply for a payment of up to $100,000 – with a minimum payment of $20,000 – to help with their cash flow to pay rent, utilities and staff.

The Commonwealth has also expanded on their payments from their first stimulus package, with employers able to receive up to 100 per cent of salary and wages withheld (up from 50 per cent), and the maximum payment has been doubled to $50,000.

The minimum payment has also increased from $2,000 to $10,000 and the tax-free disbursement will be available from 28 April.

Andrew Sykes from accounting and business advisory firm RSM told Region Media that the stimulus measures were not a cash boost per se, but rather a credit for businesses with the Australian Tax Office.

“It can be a little confusing. It is not a cash payment from the government, it is a credit to the Australian Tax Office running account,” he said.

“Eligible employers that pay salaries and wages will receive a minimum credit of $10,000 – even if they are not required to withhold tax.

“It is already in the system so businesses can now operate with confidence and know that they will not have to come up with that amount of money in the July to October period.

“No one can give a definite answer [about how many businesses will survive] but it will provide a pretty significant cash boost, and that the damage is far less than it would have been,” he said.

The Government believes the measures will benefit around 690,000 businesses and their 7.8 million employees, as well as 30,000 not-for-profits.

“They might not save every worker but there will be some that you keep on because you are getting that lower cost,” Mr Sykes said.

“It may make it viable for restaurants to do a delivery model because you get assistance with the cost of the labour, which is the biggest cost.”

Small businesses will also have half of a new loan guaranteed by the Government to the maximum loan value of $250,000 over a term of three years, with an initial six month repayment holiday.

People who are in financial stress will be able to request early access to their superannuation and can withdraw $10,000 in this financial year and $10,000 in the next financial year, tax-free. This withdrawal will not affect Centrelink or Veteran’s Affairs payments.

Mr Sykes said that while it may put some users in a more precarious financial position in the future by taking from their superannuation, this is a better alternative than other forms of debt.

“[Taking money out of your superannuation] is a concern and is only to be used if it is necessary,” he said.

“To a certain extent it is a matter of being able to balance today’s financial health with future financial health and you are better off using this than credit cards or other short-term, high-interest rate debt.”

Income or working hours need to have dropped by 20 per cent to be eligible for this measure.

Some local businesses have found themselves overwhelmed by the plethora of information and numbers flooding through over the last couple of weeks.

Mr Sykes says that small businesses should speak to their financial advisors to see what they are and are not eligible for.

“It is very confusing at the moment because we are getting different announcements and it is changing rapidly, but so is the business environment,” he said.

“It would be good if there was some assistance for businesses for them to talk to their financial advisors and get advice as to how they can take advantage of these [payments], and which ones are right for them.”","A second economic stimulus package has been unveiled over the weekend with measures including more money for welfare recipients, payments for small and medium businesses and financial stress measures to help struggling Australians.

https://the-riotact.com/george-harcourts-caremongering-is-helping-get-food-to-those-in-need/365627,George Harcourt’s ‘caremongering’ is helping get food to those in need,2020-03-24 23:00:32+11,1585090832,"As all licensed premises in Canberra closed due to COVID-19, the George Harcourt Inn at Gold Creek found a way to keep the cheer flowing, trading scaremongering for ‘caremongering’.

Before the shutdown was enforced, the George and its community-minded staff began making heavily discounted and nutritious takeaway meals for disadvantaged groups in Canberra – mainly pensioners, senior citizens and people with a disability – saving them from frustrating trips to supermarkets where the shelves were often stripped or prices had climbed beyond their means.

“We had probably a dozen elderly people who all had the same story of going to the supermarket and coming home empty-handed. It’s so distressing for them especially because they’re taking a risk just by going out, so who’s going to help them?” asked publican Josh Leemhuis.

Patrons were encouraged to make a donation to support the effort. Within 24 hours, the George had received about $6500. The ball was well and truly rolling. One lady alone donated $200.

That was last week.

Then came Sunday.

“It was a really good idea on Saturday, but after Sunday night, the situation had changed with the PM saying that pubs and clubs would be shut down. We had been able to serve about 120 meals.

“We still have about another 500 meals that can be donated to various places.”

Those 500 meals are still available for people in need and Josh and his team will continue distributing more, although the shutdown and influx of donations mean they’ve had to pause receiving further funds.

The George Harcourt Inn has closed its doors (as required) but has opened a van in the car park that will continue to serve meals to people who need them most, in line with directives that takeaway meals can continue to be sold.

The George’s brother pub, the Casey Jones Pub, is also doing a discounted takeaway menu with lots of seafood, chicken and pizza meals.

“We’re scrambling to reinvent our business and one of the things we’re going to keep doing is have our food van parked in the car park,” Josh says.

Josh and team George are also hoping they can connect with other commercial kitchens that have been forced to shut down to continue the good work.

“We all have commercial-grade kitchens, with highly trained chefs and great staff. If we can get to a point where we are supplying these sort of meals to Canberra people who are isolated or elderly, then it really unburdens a lot of our industry,” Josh explains.

Josh said packing up furniture was hard enough when the pub closed, but not as hard as telling staff there wasn’t enough work for them. He hopes the food van will help retain some staff while helping the community in a time of need.

“The staff came in here to help us pack the furniture and I don’t think there was a dry eye in the pub. It’s a pretty hard thing to do to pack up 800 or 900 pieces of furniture knowing we won’t be using them again for six months,” Josh says.

The study did not analyse pre-existing conditions but measured what public health experts describe as “excess deaths”, or the factor by which observed mortality rates exceed expected mortality rates when major risks like heatwaves, bushfires, pandemics, famine or war are present.

The study estimated that in the ACT, 229 people were admitted to hospital – 82 for cardiovascular problems, and 147 for respiratory problems – while 89 people attended the emergency department because of asthma-related issues.

There were a total of 417 estimated excess deaths because of the bushfire smoke and 4,456 hospitalisations and emergency department visits across NSW, Queensland, Victoria and the ACT.

NSW was the worst-affected state, carrying more than 50 per cent of the burden after most of the state was ravaged by bushfires, some of which started as early as July.

Between October 2019 and February 2020, the concentration of PM2.5 – fine particles that irritate the respiratory system – exceeding the 95th percentage of historical daily averages was recorded by at least one air-quality monitoring station on 94 per cent of days.

More than a third of Canberra’s summer was spent with air quality levels above hazardous as bushfire smoke blanketed the ACT. Canberra regularly had the world’s worst air quality levels on days throughout the 2020 bushfires.

The air quality in Canberra reached 22 times the hazardous threshold on New Year’s Day, dragged across from the South Coast by unrelenting easterlies.

Leading environmental health expert from ANU, Professor Sotiris Vardoulakis, said that studies are yet to conclude what constitutes long-term exposure to particulate matter but there is no safe level of exposure to bushfire smoke.

“Bushfire smoke is a major public health concern. These very small particles in bushfire smoke can penetrate deep into the respiratory system inducing inflammation and even translocate into the bloodstream,” Professor Vardoulakis said.

“Mortality rates have been found to increase in Sydney on days with high bushfire smoke pollution.

“For most people, it [was] like smoking a few cigarettes a day – it increas[ed] the risk of developing lung and heart disease in their lifetime.”

The report also found that stronger bushfire mitigation and adaption techniques were urgently needed to help lessen the impacts and severity of future fires which are made worse because of widespread drought and heatwaves across Australia.","A summer marked by hazardous air quality and bushfire smoke may have cost 31 Canberrans their lives, according to a new study published in the Medical Journal of Australia.

https://the-riotact.com/da-lodged-for-six-storey-common-ground-complex-in-dickson/365546,DA lodged for six-storey Common Ground complex in Dickson,2020-03-24 21:00:28+11,1585083628,"More parking and a shared path have been added to the proposed Common Ground social housing project in Dickson as a result of community consultation, but it will still face opposition for its six-storey building height and the need to rezone the site.

A development application has been lodged for the government-backed project on the old Downer Club site on Hawden Place Block 25 Section 72, which will consist of two, four and six-storey sections containing a mix of 40 self-contained one to three-bedroom units.

Half the units will go to the long-term homeless or people at risk of being homeless and half to those on low-incomes shut out of the private rental market. The project includes on-site health, social and financial support for residents.

The Common Ground concept has broad community backing but the North Canberra Community Council remains concerned about the lack of an integrated plan for Section 72 and the suitability of the site.

The council’s Jane Goffman said it was not clear how this piece of the puzzle fitted in to the precinct as a whole.

“We’re no longer doing integrated planning we’re doing piecemeal planning,” she said.

The council believed the 6,968 square metre site, which will need to be rezoned from leisure and accommodation to community use, was a flood hazard and contaminated with asbestos.

Ms Goffman said it was also not desirable to house vulnerable people at an isolated location on the edge of the precinct.

The council is also seeking extra time to respond in light of the coronavirus restrictions.

Section 72 is bounded by Cowper and Antill Streets and Hawdon Place, and already includes facilities such as the Dickson pool, community centre and child care facility.

The government envisages a mix of uses in Section 72, including open space and opportunities for additional community uses as part of mixed-use developments.

The energy-efficient development, designed by Collins Caddaye Architects, includes basement car parking, a central communal courtyard, public park and community gardens.

Common Ground staff will have space for an office, meeting room and storage, while the ground floor incorporates room for a social enterprise and community space which can be shared with the wider community.

Changes to the original proposal include a driveway for garbage trucks which will also have 10 car parking spaces (five for staff) and the redesign of a stub road to the north of the site to allow for 37 parking bays.

The basement has been modified so that a minimum of 36 parking spaces are provided, including 20 accessible car parking spaces. If none of the accessible parking spaces is required, the car park can be reconfigured to provide 45 spaces. It will also include bicycle spaces and storage

There will also be eight extra parking spaces along the eastern verge of Hawdon Place.

A footpath and shared space for pedestrians and cyclists will be provided in front of the social enterprise.

A traffic study estimates that the total number of daily vehicle trips to be in the range of four to five vehicle trips for each one and two-bedroom unit, and 5-6.5 for each three-bedroom unit, resulting in a daily maximum of 212 vehicle movements and a peak of 21.

The vacant site contains one regulated tree, a large cypress pine tree facing Hawdon Place, which will be retained and incorporated into the overall landscape design for the development.

The site is not far from the Dickson Group Centre. To the west is land leased to the Salvation Army plus a Dance School and childcare centre. Directly north are the Canberra Parklands Apartments, while to the east are the Dickson District Playing Fields and the Dickson Wetlands.

There are mainly single-storey residential dwellings to the south.","The energy-efficient development, designed by Collins Caddaye Architects, includes basement car parking, a central communal courtyard, public park and community gardens.

I was beginning to feel anxious about it before it was called off.

Sports commentators by their very nature are a resilient group. Essentially radio commentators just get in and call what is in front of them, at the same time avoiding distractions and contrary thoughts entering the mind. Concentrating on what the listener is hearing is paramount.

Essentially I am there on my own talking rapidly for close to three hours without a safety net. Only the co-commentators allow time for a break and to alternate the flow. Their role is critical to telling the story to the listener.

Every commentator will tell you it is an adrenalin rush. By the end of the game I am drained, unable to have a meaningful conversation for some time after getting off-air, and more often than not, unable to sleep properly.

Having said that I know it is a privilege to able to commentate. I love it, and that’s why I’ve been involved in broadcasting for over 30 years.

Usually in the lead up to a game there is considerable anticipation. And preparation is the key. I often try to visualise possible scenarios and outcomes.

It’s been that way for as long as I can remember since I began my commentary career.

But in the lead up to Thursday night’s game between the Raiders and the Dragons it was hard to prepare. Somehow it didn’t seem right for me to be commentating at an empty stadium while the rest of the community was effectively in lockdown.

Sport in these uncertain times can offer an escape, and I am the first to admit that I love commentating the Raiders. I bleed green and was looking forward to watching them play but at the same time I felt uncomfortable being part of something that went against the grain of what everybody else was being told to do.

That said, and this may sound hypocritical, I was prepared to commentate the game, having committed to do it at the start of the season. I also knew full well that the NRL and the Raiders were doing everything possible to ensure protection for everybody involved. In no way did I feel as though I was putting my health at risk – or anybody else’s.

In the end, though, the NRL’s decision yesterday (23 March) to suspend the 2020 season was the sensible thing to do.

Simultaneously, I feel for the people involved with the Raiders club, and for that matter, at the Brumbies and all other sports organisations and individual athletes. They now face an uncertain time with cutbacks inevitable until sport resumes.

I regard many of them as friends, and desperately hope they are all still okay at the end of this.","I was scheduled to commentate the Raiders versus St George-Illawarra NRL game on Thursday night at GIO Stadium.

The situation is so severe, property leaders are calling on the federal government for urgent assistance.

Independent Managing Director, Property Management, Hannah Gill said their office has been inundated with calls from tenants who have lost their jobs.

“This is a very sad and stressful situation for so many people,” Ms Gill said. “People have lost their jobs and are scared of losing their home.”

Amidst the worry, Ms Gill reports there is some kindness emerging with many landlords offering to help their tenants.

“Landlords have been in contact with us this week, reaching out to offer assistance to their tenants. It is lovely to see such kindness. In this unprecedented situation, it is important for all of us to be kind and remember we are all people. We understand that not everyone is in a position to help but it is nice to see this happening where people can.”

Canberra property managers are urging tenants to make contact with their agents so they can help find a way through the economic hardship many people are facing and provide information on available resources.

“The best advice we can give is to contact your property manager early. We want to help and the sooner we know the better. If we don’t know, we can’t let the landlord know and therefore we will follow the standard arrears processes.”

Ms Gill points out that rental arrears are a systemic problem.

“If tenants can’t pay their rent, most landlords then can’t pay their bills and mortgage and property managers won’t receive income to pay their staff. It affects everyone. We need to keep everyone going where we can,” Ms Gill said.

Ms Gill is a current board member of the Real Estate Institute of the ACT (REIACT) and says together with the other institutes, they have been pushing the Federal Government to deliver strategies to help tenants in hardship. The REIACT is hoping the government will recognise the economic relationship between all parties and that measures will be announced soon.

Ms Gill says the challenge at present is to educate everyone on what assistance is available for both tenants and landlords.

“This is new. Many people have never had to seek assistance. We hope some government assistance will be announced in the coming days. In the meantime we are encouraging tenants to seek assistance from local resources as soon as possible.”

Tenants can seek assistance from local resources such as Anglicare, Commonwealth Rent Assistance and Vinnies.","“This is a very sad and stressful situation for so many people,” Ms Gill said.

https://the-riotact.com/no-draconian-lockdown-yet-but-pm-bans-travel-and-increases-social-distancing/365820,UPDATED: national commission appointed by PM to manage COVID-19 response,2020-03-24 19:00:06+11,1585076406,"UPDATED: 12:15 pm, 25 March

The Prime Minister has announced a high-level national coordination commission for coronavirus to manage the economic and organisational challenges the virus is presenting.

The commission will be headed by former Fortescue Metals chief executive Nev Power and includes former senior public servant Jane Halton, former union leader and Labor politician Greg Combet, Paul Little who formerly headed Toll, Catherine Tanner who heads of Energy Australia. The deputy chair will be former Telstra chief David Thodey.

Prime Minister and Cabinet Secretary Phil Gaetjens – a long time close associate of the Prime Minister – and Home Affairs secretary Mike Pezzullo will be assisting the new commission.

Mr Morrison said the commission will be tasked with reaching into corporate Australia to solve problems.

“I want to give confidence that the best people in the country are working to solve the problems and challenges that confront us so we get through to the other side,” Mr Morrison said.

Mr Power said “I think Australia right now, more than anything, needs to focus on minimising and mitigating the impact of coronavirus and its impact on jobs. My role will be looking for problems and opportunities to join businesses together to solve problems.”

This might happen through workforce redeployment, intervention in supply chains and planning for a post-virus future, although Mr Power said they also needed to be aware that the virus might come and go in waves.

“We will need to restore jobs and livelihood as soon as possible,” he added.

The Prime Minister also confirmed that in line with expert medical advice, all elective surgery other than Category 1 and urgent Category 2 cases will be suspended across public and private systems from midnight, allowing resources and equipment to be reserved and prepared for the COVID-19 outbreak’s peak.

Mr Morrison said that as of this morning, 162,747 COVID-19 tests had been administered, five times the UK testing rate, 25 times higher than the US testing rates and higher than the South Korean testing rate.

“We are right at top of the leader board on testing,” Mr Morrison said. “The testing resources we are securing and contact tracing we are doing are the most important jobs we have as governments to best manage this virus.”

ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr said that the ACT Government will be introducing further tough restrictions on social and community activities to help slow the spread of COVID-19. He described these as difficult but essential decisions and conceded they would result in more Canberrans losing their jobs.

“I need to be clear that this is likely to be further restrictions rather than fewer”, Mr Barr said.

The ACT will be following the directions from National Cabinet, but also be aligning with NSW wherever possible on shutting down non-essential services to protect public health. “We simply can not afford to have different rules for Canberra than the rules in our surrounding region”, he said, adding that it is only a matter of time before further restrictions come into place.

“They will be tougher and they will hurt. But they will save lives”, Mr Barr said.

“I can assure Canberrans that we are working desperately hard to ensure they have access to the services they need – supermarkets will stay open as will pharmacies, petrol stations, banks, post offices and animal welfare services. We will keep the power on, and the water running.

“We will do this so Canberrans can stay at home, and that’s what we all need to do now. For the foreseeable future, there is no social occasion, no party, no celebration or family get together that is a higher priority than the lives of the people around us.

“I am asking Canberrans to help each other and take care of each other”.

The full list of restrictions is now available from the ACT Health website, www.health.act.gov.au. Businesses seeking advice about their situation can call the Business Liaison team on (02) 6205 0900.

Australia’s Chief Health Officer Brendan Murphy, says he is very concerned by the rapid rise in COVID-19 diagnoses. Photo: RACGP.The Prime Minister told a briefing after last night’s National Cabinet meeting that “we need to keep Australia running” but social distancing measures must increase substantially.

It appears that there’s still contention over how schools will operate, but multiple activities including real estate open houses and auctions, health clubs and classes and beauty services have been banned from operating.

Weddings can take place with only the couple, celebrant and witnesses present and funerals are restricted to 10 participants.

The former hard directive regarding travel is now a ban under the biosecurity powers after the Prime Minister said he was “disappointed” that a small number of Australians continue to travel overseas for non-essential reasons.

Describing widespread business closures as “heartbreaking events in our nation”s history”, Mr Morrison said, “I want to assure all Australians that as the National and Federal cabinets meet, and State governments, we are not unconscious of the real impacts these measures are having on daily lives of Australians”.

But he rejected calls for a more draconian lockdown.

“Be careful what we wish for,” he warned. “That would need to be sustained for a very long time and have a very significant and even more onerous impact on life in Australia.”

Mr Morrison described a unified decision-making process despite acknowledging that not all states and territories are at the same stage of contagion.

The new orders largely expand on existing measures and will apply from midnight tonight (25 March).

Takeaway food provision can continue from cafes, while food courts must cease operating (although they can still provide takeaways) and auctions, house inspections and open houses are banned.

Outdoor and indoor markets (excluding food markets, which are classed as an essential service) will be addressed by states and territories under their own legislation.

Beauty therapy, tanning, waxing, tattoos, spa and massages, with the exception of health-related services like physiotherapy, must cease. Hairdressers and barbers can continue to operate but with a 30-minute limit for each customer.

In addition to restrictions on cinemas, concerts and stadiums, amusement parks and arcades are now banned from operation as are play centres, health clubs, fitness centres, barre and yoga classes, saunas and bathhouses. However, boot camps and personal training can continue if limited to 10 people and with appropriate social distancing measures.

Galleries, museums, youth centres, libraries, pools, community halls, clubs and places of worship should also close their doors.

“Stay at home unless it’s necessary that you go out. Go out for the basics or medical need only,” Mr Morrison said. “Do not congregate together in groups.”

Mr Morrison remains firm that schools are safe and that it’s necessary for them to remain open, but it’s clear that negotiations between stakeholders are continuing.

Expressing concerns over the impacts on children’s education if schools closed, the Prime Minister said he would “discuss a set of arrangements we would like to proceed with that keeps schools open, that will also protect those teachers and other staff working in schools” in the following days.

He said schools should re-open after the forthcoming term break to enable people without other options to continue sending their children.

“For all those workers who need to send children to school, that’s why schools remain open,” the Prime Minister said. “Everyone who has a job in this economy is an essential worker.

“Everyone who has one needs to be able to keep doing their job. That means they will need to keep sending their children to school for an education.”

Chief Medical Officer Dr Brendan Murphy told the briefing that “we are very worried about the rate of rise in infections. It is a very steep growth and very concerning”.

He said much of the growth in Australian COVID-19 diagnoses was still driven by returning travellers and therefore putting the community at risk by failing to observe quarantine would not be tolerated.

“Don’t go anywhere on your way home. If you are identified as a contact, you must isolate. You must not go to the chemist when you’ve been told you have the disease. If you are isolating you go home and obey those rules,” he said.

While Dr Murphy said there was still no evidence of widespread community transmission, he added that there are undoubtedly hot spots requiring restrictive measures.","UPDATED: 12:15 pm, 25 MarchThe Prime Minister has announced a high-level national coordination commission for coronavirus to manage the economic and organisational challenges the virus is presenting.

Wedding venues in the Blue Mountains take advantage of the gorgeous scenery and proximity to Sydney, meaning that it won’t take you long to travel to this incredible national park.

If you’re the sort of couple that is obsessed with beautiful australian mountains, then the blue mountains are the perfect place for you.

What season is best to have a blue mountains wedding?

The blue mountains are busy with tourists most of the year, although the wedding seasons in Australia are typically from September to May, with a slight dip between December and January, just as the temperatures can reach a high of up to 29°C.

Many couples prefer to have a wedding somewhere from September to November, and February to May, so that the heat isn’t too much. If you feel particularly adventurous, you can also have a winter wedding, which may also mean that some venues are cheaper.

What other activities are there to do when having a blue mountains wedding?

There are some amazing things to do in The Blue Mountains. Lots of incredible adventures are in store for you if you are in staying in the local area in and around your wedding:

Glow worm tunnels – Travel North a short while and you’ll be able to see the Glow worm tunnels at Newnes Plateau.

Tonnes of waterfalls – my personal favourites are Nellies Glen, and Wentworth Falls.

Japanese Bath House – This hot spring is styled just like a Japanese Bath house, and is a short drive away in South Bowenfels.

Lincoln’s Rock – One of the most iconic lookout spots in the Blue Mountains

Caving in Jenolan Caves – If you’re feeling like a bit more of a high octane adventure, you can always go caving in Jenolan caves.

Why should I elope?

There are some amazing reasons to elope:

It provides a more authentic and intimate experience together

They value experiences over things

They don’t want the stress of families

They are more introverted and prefer to have a more private ceremony

Whilst the idea of having a wedding appeals to a lot of couples, couples who elope prefer to have a day that is more focused on them, rather than trying to please everyone around them.

Instead of having to battle with families and deal with big family drama, they instead prefer to have a ceremony and experience which has a focus more on them.

One of the biggest reasons to elope is that couples prefer the idea of experiences over things. For example, couples eloping in Australia prefer the idea of travelling around the national parks of New South Wales, over spending tens of thousands of dollars on a stuffy venue.

Couples who elope believe that they are better off investing their money in the adventure of a lifetime, rather than on hundreds of guests and a fancy venue that simply doesn’t reflect them.

If you’re a couple who values having experiences over things, and doesn’t want the big family drama associated with a traditional big wedding, elopements are for you.

Difference between wedding and elopement?

The differences between weddings and elopements are:

Elopements are based around a location outside in nature, for example by the coast or on top of a mountain, whereas weddings can be held inside a venue.

Elopements are just the bride and groom, with two witnesses, whereas weddings will have many guests present and watching the ceremony.

Elopements can revolve over several days and turn into an adventure travelling around a country or location, whereas weddings are typically done in one day.

The term elopement means something a little big different from what it used to. Whilst eloping used to mean running away it’s a bit different now. In this context, the meaning of elope is not to run away for good, but rather to have a more intimate and private ceremony and experience.

What you need to do to elope in Australia

Couples want to elope in Australia but are unsure of how to elope. Looking where to elope in Australia is one part of the equation. Whilst the experience is different (and more exciting), the legal process is the same. When it comes to legally getting married and eloping in Australia, there are a few key things you need to do:

Not be married.

Not be marrying a parent, grandparent, child, grandchild, brother or sister.

Be at least 18 years old, unless a court has approved a marriage where 1 person is 16-18 years old.

Understand what marriage means and freely agree to marry.

Use specific words during the ceremony.

Give a notice of intended marriage form to an authorised marriage celebrant at least 1 month and no more than 18 months before your wedding.

Be married by an authorised marriage celebrant.

You don’t have to be an Australian citizen or a permanent resident of Australia.

You also need to:

Complete a notice of intended marriage form.

Give it to an authorised marriage celebrant at least 1 month (but not more than 18 months) before your wedding.

It’s that straightforward!



Bonus: hire an elopement photographer

When it comes to planning one of the biggest and most exciting journeys of your life, you want someone to capture the experience for you so that you can live in the moment, instead of taking your phone out every two minutes.

An experienced elopement photographer will:

Plan a timeline of your day from start to finish.

Provide all details of what should be required for you to elope, country specific.

Location scout and provide a set of recommended elopement locations based upon what you are both drawn to in terms of landscape and climate.

Be there to capture and immortalise your day and experience in real artwork that you will look back and relive for the rest of your days.

Be able to create and design an archival wedding album for you to read and relive.

Deliver all final images within 4-6 weeks.

A note on the Australian Bush Fires of 2019-2020

From the end of 2019 to the start of 2020, Australia faced serious damage and destruction from bushfires around the country.

The locations noted in this ultimate guide do not take into account areas which have been damaged by bushfires. Unfortunately for me to assess the individual damage of each recommended elopement location, it would take an insane amount of time.

I recommend that if you are interested in a location, simply google the location and ‘bush fire damage’. The main states which were affected heaviest were New South Wales and the ACT.

A very important note is that whilst there was significant damage done to the landscape, with early rains in 2020, a lot of sites are now displaying signs of regeneration. Indeed, indigenous Australians managed the landscape by burning it.

This means that when you’re looking where to elope in Australia, and come across an area you really like and believe the damage to be minimal, I say there is nothing wrong with using this as your preferred elopement location.
