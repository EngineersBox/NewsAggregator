# Redis GCRA Rate Limiter

GCRA is a variation of leaky bucket designed for Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks.
GCRA works by tracking remaining limit through a time called the “theoretical arrival time” (TAT),
which is seeded on the first request by adding a duration representing its cost to the current time.
The cost is calculated as a multiplier of our “emission interval” (T), which is derived from the rate
at which we want the bucket to refill. When any subsequent request comes in, we take the existing TAT,
subtract a fixed buffer representing the limit’s total burst capacity from it (τ + T), and compare the
result to the current time. This result represents the next time to allow a request. If it’s in the
past, we allow the incoming request, and if it’s in the future, we don’t. After a successful request,
a new TAT is calculated by adding T.
